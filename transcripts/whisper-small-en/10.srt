00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,360
In this podcast, I'll be speaking with Matt Caberlin at the University of Washington.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,400
I met Matt about a year and a half, maybe two years ago through David Sabatini, who some of you

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,960
may be familiar with just based on all of his remarkable work around mTOR and Rapa Mison.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,920
Matt's recognized globally for his research in the biology of aging. He got his PhD

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,240
from MIT in the lab of Lenny Garante, who's produced a number of notable folks in this field.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,880
He went on to his post-doc at the University of Washington. And after completing his post-doc,

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,160
he has remained there and continues to run a fantastic lab. In this episode, we're going to

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,360
talk about his experience as the director of the Dog Aging Project, which as its name suggests,

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,520
focuses on the animal model of dogs for its research. Now, of course, this is really

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,360
interesting because while fruit flies and yeast and mice are interesting, dogs are obviously much

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,720
closer to us. And of course, these dogs, because they're pets generally, have something really

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,720
unique to us that virtually no other research animal has, which is they share our environment.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,360
And this puts them in a pretty unique spot that even the rhesus monkeys studied in the

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,640
NIA Wisconsin Project didn't have going for them. Now, if you haven't already done so,

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,080
I'd recommend listening to the podcast that I did with David Sabatini, because that will get you

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,360
some of the background on mTOR and Rapa Mison. I think we get a little technical in this podcast,

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,600
but I suspect it's something that if you've listened to that other one with Sabatini,

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,560
you'll have the background to follow. And we talk about a bunch of other things that people seem to

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,520
be interested in as well beyond Rapa Mison and aging. We also talk about NAD, probably get into

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,920
Sirtuins a little bit. The other thing I really enjoy about speaking with Matt, and I had so many

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,160
discussions with Matt over meals and stuff where I think to myself after, man, I wish that was

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,080
recorded because one, I want to be able to hear it again. And two, it's the kind of stuff that

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,560
people are always asking me. And I think Matt just has such an amazing way of thinking about this

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,280
stuff. Matt's work is really remarkable because it's actually focusing on health span. It's easier

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,760
in some ways to study health span because you can study it over a shorter period of time. And in

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,560
particular, when you look at the cardiomyopathy model, meaning it's a type of heart failure that

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,040
dogs experience, and you look at how Rapa Mison can improve ejection fraction, you can get these

35
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,680
answers in a really quick period of time. In fact, much quicker than I think Matt even expected. And

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,000
we talk of course about cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. So if you're interested in

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Rapa Mison, if you're interested in mTOR, if you're interested in longevity, I think you're going to

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,880
find this interview very interesting. It was actually recorded initially in December of 2017

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,320
as part of the interview series I was doing for my book. And we may at some point throw up the

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,360
video as well. You can find a lot more information in the show notes of course. And without further

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:29,320
delay, here's my conversation with the remarkable Matt Caperly. Matt, thank you so much for being

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,000
here. It's really fantastic to be able to talk with you in this format. I've been a huge fan of

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,160
your work for many years now. Obviously I know quite a bit about your background, but I think

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,080
it'd be great for the listeners to kind of get a sense of, you know, what did you study in college?

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,400
How did you end up doing your PhD? Where did you do it? And most of all, why did it get you where you are?

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,320
Sure. So I got undergraduate degrees in biochemistry and mathematics at Western Washington

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,520
University. And then I went to graduate school at MIT, the biology department there. And my background

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,840
up till that point had been in biophysical chemistry. So I really went to graduate school

49
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,280
thinking I was going to work on structural biology or x-ray crystallography or something like that.

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,520
And I heard a seminar by Lenny Granty, who I ended up doing my PhD thesis with during my first

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,920
semester at MIT, where he started talking about how his lab had begun working on the genetics of

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,120
aging and trying to understand, you know, what are the factors that influence the rate of aging? And

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,520
this was in yeast. That's what his lab worked on at that point. And it was really almost like an

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,200
aha moment where it just clicked with me that it was really fascinating that you could use

55
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,000
genetics and molecular biology and biochemistry to study something as complicated and fundamental as

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,520
the biology of aging. And so I got fascinated by the topic. I ended up going and talking to Lenny

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,920
and then subsequently doing my thesis research with him. So it was really that moment of hearing

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,880
him talk my first year in graduate school that got me interested in aging. And that's what I've been

59
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,320
fascinated by and passionate about since then. And so then I went on and did a postdoc with Stan

60
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Fields at the University of Washington, also working on aging, and then ultimately started

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,600
my own lab. So it's been almost two decades now that I've been working on this problem.

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,640
And if my memory serves me correctly, when you were in Lenny's lab, who's obviously no stranger

63
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,000
to probably people who are listening to this, you worked on sirtuins, correct? Yeah. So my thesis

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,200
work was actually the work that first showed that if you activated or overexpressed a sirtuin,

65
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,400
in this case it was sirtu, the founding member of the sirtuins in yeast, that you could extend

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,800
lifespan and slow aging. And obviously we were very excited about that, especially when a postdoc who

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,240
was in the lab at that time, Heidi Tissenbaum, about a year later, showed that you could also

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,320
overexpressed the worm version of sirtu and extend lifespan in C. elegans. And so that was really

69
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,280
the first example of a conserved genetic modifier of lifespan across two widely

70
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,800
evolutionarily divergent organisms. Because it was a relatively similar version of sirtu. Yeah.

71
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,080
So more different than the DAF stuff that we saw in C. elegans versus the IGF that we would see in

72
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,640
some of the higher mammals. Right. So at that time we knew that DAF2 could extend lifespan in

73
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,560
C. elegans. I don't think we knew it was working that similar mechanism. That's right. Yeah.

74
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,200
Now I think one of the things that makes your work so interesting is that you work on dogs. Right.

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,720
How did you end up doing that? Yeah. So that's relatively new in my career. It was about four

76
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,520
years ago when Daniel Promislow moved from the University of Georgia to the University of

77
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:55,000
Washington. And Daniel had started thinking about dogs as a model to understand how genetic

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,520
and environmental factors influence the aging process. And I'm a dog person. I've always had

79
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,560
dogs. I have three dogs now. That qualifies. Yeah. Right. And I had never really made the

80
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,320
connection between dogs as companion animals and dogs as a model for understanding aging until I

81
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,200
talked with Daniel about this. And through those conversations it occurred to me that not only could

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:26,440
we understand genetic and environmental modifiers of aging but our pets could actually serve as a

83
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,080
transformative next step in testing some of these things that we know work in laboratory mammals

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,360
like mice but have never yet been taken outside of the laboratory. And so it was really that sort of

85
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,960
connection in my mind about three years ago that propelled me to really move forward with the dog

86
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,840
aging project. One major goal of which is to actually do this to take some of the interventions

87
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,200
that we know extend lifespan and slow aging in the laboratory and test whether they have that effect

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,600
in the real world in a larger mammal that's also very socially relevant. I think that that's an

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,760
important aspect of this. People love their dogs. If we can actually slow aging in people's pets

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,280
that's going to have a huge impact both on the quality of life for the pets and the owners

91
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,200
but also the way that people think about the biology of aging. They're going to believe it a

92
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,960
lot more if they see that their dog is living longer and aging more slowly than just reading

93
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,760
an article in the New York Times or wherever. Right. Right. And it's you know I sort of when I

94
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,280
talk about this I generally talk about these four classes of eukaryotes going from you know

95
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,480
yeast to flies worms and mammals but usually when we talk about mammals we're talking about mice.

96
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,840
Absolutely. They have a couple of problems at least right. One problem is they're generally

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,920
especially if they're inbred I mean they're homozygous at all low size so right you have to

98
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,800
question their applicability to us in terms of their susceptibility to disease. But then the

99
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,840
second point which you alluded to which I think the dogs might be the first quote unquote laboratory

100
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,080
study that gets out of this is they don't live in our environment. Right. The mice that is right.

101
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,120
Right. So so so the dog truly lives in the environment you and I live in which

102
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,840
at least in theory should be the environment we care most about preventing aging in. That's right.

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,520
I think I think that environmental variation is hugely important. The genetics is also important

104
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,720
and dogs are so there's there's a couple of things that are worth mentioning. Dogs have some

105
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:34,440
of that same genetic homogeneity if you look within individual purebred breeds. But we also have

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,520
many purebred breeds that are widely divergent both genetically and morphologically. All you have

107
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,200
to do is look at a chihuahua on a Great Dane right to see that divergence. But we also have this really

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,240
interesting and complex mixed breed population that's a combination of all these different

109
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,360
genetic variants that each breed has. So so we have kind of the best of both worlds in the sense

110
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,280
that if you want to do a study in a relatively genetically restricted background you can do it

111
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,760
in a specific breed or set of breeds. But if you want to capture that genetic variation all you have

112
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,800
to do is look in the mixed breed dogs. But the environmental part of this I think is probably

113
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,680
the most important from what are we going to learn from dogs that we can't learn from mice

114
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,720
perspective. As you said dogs really share our environment to a greater extent than any other

115
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,720
animal maybe with the exception of cats. And so they're drinking the same water. In fact may not

116
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,800
even be drinking the same water. Most people maybe drink it worse. Yeah right are not going to give

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,040
their dog bottled water right. But they're breathing the same air. If you smoke they're

118
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,440
experiencing that or someone in the house smokes they're experiencing that secondhand smoke. So

119
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,720
they really do capture most of our environment. The diet is about the only place where dogs don't

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,720
quite have the same sort of nutritional diversity that people do. But with the exception of diet

121
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,840
the environment is pretty close. Now we have a pretty good idea of how we die. Right I could

122
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,720
actuarially map out how you and I are going to die based on our age and a whole bunch of other factors.

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,000
Again it's probably an oversimplification because of this species diversification. But as a general

124
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,480
rule how do dogs die. Yeah so I'll make one quick comment on that. First of all that I think you're

125
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,520
right that we do know what diseases most often kill people. And that's important information.

126
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm not sure it's the most important information because what people die from does not always

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,320
equate to what they die with. Especially today most people are dying with chronic diseases and

128
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,840
multiple comorbidities. Right. So just because you may die from heart disease it doesn't mean

129
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,040
that you didn't have kidney disease or something moving towards kidney disease or diabetes. So I

130
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,560
think it's important to appreciate that there are that you can have multiple diseases and only one

131
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,000
of them is probably going to kill you. Having said that it is useful to think about do dogs die from

132
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,760
and with the same age related diseases that people do. And the answer is in general the

133
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,880
equivalency is pretty good. So dogs get all of the same age related diseases that people do. They

134
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,720
don't get them at the same frequency necessarily. So one big difference is in dogs there's actually

135
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,560
relatively little vascular disease which is a major killer in people. So specifically

136
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,920
atherosclerosis whether it be peripherally or cardiovascularly doesn't seem to be as prevalent.

137
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,880
Does not seem to be as prevalent. But there are breeds that die from from heart disease

138
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,000
and certain forms of heart disease. Cancer is probably the most common cause of death in dogs

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,720
and big dogs tend to get more cancers than small dogs. But across all dogs cancer is probably the

140
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,520
number one cause of death. Kidney disease is a major cause of death in dogs. Is the etiology

141
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,760
of that kidney disease related to blood pressure? Is it related to some other nephrotic syndrome

142
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,160
that's otherwise unidentified? I don't know the answer to that. Yeah I don't I don't have the

143
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,480
veterinary background to answer that. One of the things that's interesting in dogs is that there's

144
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,600
seems to be a little bit of a debate whether dogs really get Alzheimer's disease. They clearly get

145
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,880
dementia some dogs do and they clearly show cognitive decline. It's not completely clear

146
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,200
whether they get what would be clinically diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease in people.

147
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Apparently they do accumulate a beta in the brain whether they get the plaques and tangles still

148
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,240
seems to be a little bit up in the air and there are people studying that. But at least at the level

149
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,240
of cognitive dysfunction and dementia it's clear that dogs experience that with age as well. So

150
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,440
for the most part they do develop the same age related diseases. The increase in risk for those

151
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,800
diseases goes up essentially exponentially just like in people. But the relative prevalence of

152
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,640
specific diseases is not always the same and can also be breed dependent. So there it is certainly

153
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:54,280
the case that within purebred dogs different breeds have different predispositions to certain

154
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,840
diseases which is exactly what you'd expect based on the genetics. So basically they're probably

155
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,040
getting a little more cancer significantly more renal failure as a proximate cause of death as

156
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,960
opposed to dying with renal insufficiency which to your point I think a lot of humans do. They're

157
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,120
getting a lot of heart disease but it sounds like it's more cardiomyopathy and or valvular disease

158
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,720
but not atherosclerotic or ischemic disease. And they unfortunately die of accidents just as humans

159
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,520
do which would still probably be in the top four for humans and dogs I'm guessing. Yeah and actually

160
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,680
that's an interesting point you're right. What I haven't seen great data on is the age distribution

161
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,760
of death due to trauma. I suspect it's going to be mostly younger dogs but I don't know for sure. So

162
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,000
that's actually an interesting question. It is absolutely true. The other thing that is worth

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,800
noting about dogs is it's actually the case that most pet dogs don't die from an age related disease.

164
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,440
They die from euthanasia which is a difference between dogs and people. Yes that's a great point.

165
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,640
Well let's turn the discussion now to what you do about this. I've been a big fan of rapamycin and

166
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,680
tor and that entire pathway for several years now. It's become almost an obsession. If one can have

167
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,680
an obsession that's not pathologic. And I think what attracted me to your work a couple of years

168
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,200
ago probably David Sabatini pointed me in your direction. So maybe three years ago it was actually

169
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:24,520
after the manic paper came out in 2014. Yeah 2014. Really interesting look at the human data.

170
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,200
I want to come back to that paper as it relates to immune function and stuff but maybe give us a

171
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,880
sense of how you decided that the next logical step was to actually test the god molecule as I

172
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,680
like to call it. Rapamycin in this context. In dogs yeah. Yeah so again this was all happening

173
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:52,120
about three years ago when I first sort of made the leap to thinking that we could test interventions

174
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,240
in dogs. And actually that's not at least for me was not an immediate it wasn't immediately

175
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,640
obvious to me that we should. So you really have to think as soon as you start talking about

176
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,040
bringing trial of a drug out of the lab and into the real world whether it's the human clinic or

177
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,960
the veterinary clinic in the context of aging you really have to start to think about safety

178
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,800
and side effects right because there is a very low tolerance for side effects when you're talking

179
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,840
about treating a healthy person or dog. So that was the first thing that I had to really

180
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,360
come to grips with is could we do this safely and especially you were thinking we're not going to

181
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,880
take dogs that are already sick. That's right. We were going to take healthy dogs. That's right. I

182
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,920
mean for me as somebody who is fundamentally interested in the biology of aging the intent

183
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,760
is to slow aging in people before they get sick right to keep them healthy longer. So in many

184
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,840
ways it's it's the opposite of traditional medical approach biomedical research right where normally

185
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,520
historically we wait until people are sick and then we try to cure their disease. This is the

186
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,680
reverse of that right. So that's right. So so because we are talking about intervening in a healthy

187
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,080
person or a dog the tolerance for side effects from a regulatory perspective or even just

188
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,680
public perception is very low when you're talking about a healthy person. Now you know the way I

189
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,520
view that first of all I think that is we need as a society and and within the scientific community

190
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,680
to have a discussion about this because I think that we need to recognize that a healthy

191
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,280
70 year old is not the same as a healthy 30 year old right. And we know what's going to happen if

192
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,240
we don't do anything about aging. So my personal view is that there should be a tolerance for some

193
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:47,000
level of risk if the outcome is going to be 10 percent 20 percent 30 percent more time spent

194
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,040
in good health. That's that's a discussion that we haven't had either at the regulatory level or at

195
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,800
the society wide level. But I think we need to have. So I digress a little bit but I had to know

196
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,120
I think I think that's one of the most important points you could make and I sort of think a lot

197
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,960
about this because my colleague and I were discussing this the other day which was you know

198
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,400
you take this oath at the end of medical school the Hippocratic oath when you first thing you learn

199
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,520
to say is first do no harm. And I think the spirit of that is excellent but I also think it's highly

200
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,080
impractical in a world where it forces you into binary thinking which is we will only undertake

201
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,920
interventions that are guaranteed to have no harm and otherwise we will do nothing regardless of the

202
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,560
outcome which of course is not practical. We live in a probabilistic world where the probability of

203
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,800
harm is not zero or one but rather it's a continuum between zero and one and you really

204
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,280
need to take a risk adjusted approach. That's right. To outcome. So I mean I think that's a

205
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,600
yeah that's exactly right. So I had to kind of go through that thought process in my own head though

206
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,120
and especially thinking about moving into pet dogs where because of the way that that many people

207
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,800
feel about their pet dogs you have to be as sure as you can that you're not going to hurt anybody's

208
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,280
pet. They like them more than their friends. Yeah absolutely right. Yeah people love their dogs.

209
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,360
A lot of people feel similarly about their dogs as they do about their kids right. So you kind of

210
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,240
think that's kind of the way I thought about it is could we do this in somebody's child. And so with

211
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,840
rapamycin there is a perception out there that I don't share but there's a perception out there

212
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,040
that rapamycin has lots of side effects based mostly on the human clinical literature. Which to

213
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,840
be clear is generally in transplant patients. Transplant patients taking high doses and taking

214
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,880
lots of other drugs. Yeah so sick people taking a high dose of rapamycin in combination with other

215
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,360
medications. Right. And it does have side effects. There's no question about that but one of the

216
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,640
things that's come out of my own research and other research in the field is that the both the

217
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:52,120
benefits and the side effects are strongly linked to dose. So one question was is there a dose of

218
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,360
rapamycin that will have beneficial effects in the context of healthy aging without significant

219
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,800
side effects. That was an unknown. I think that we're getting to the point where we're pretty sure

220
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,560
that that's the case. At least you can get some of the benefits of rapamycin and we can talk more

221
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,520
about the data that support that. But at that point it really wasn't really wasn't clear. And

222
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,680
when you say the dose do you think that the peak or the trough play a bigger role in toxicity. Yeah

223
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,720
so that's that's still an unknown but I think the data that are out there suggest that the trough

224
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,880
levels are most strongly correlated with side effects. Now what is most strongly related to

225
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,560
health span or lifespan. There's no data as far as I know. And this is an area where I think there's

226
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,640
a lot of work that could be done and should be done exploring more broadly even in laboratory

227
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,000
animals and mice. The sort of dose response and dose timing space for where do you get the

228
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,680
biggest effects on lifespan or specific measures of health. Where don't you get any effects. Can

229
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,120
you uncouple say the improvements in heart function from the improvements in immune function

230
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,840
by changing the dose or the timing. There really has been very little done on that. Now maybe for

231
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,920
the listener who's not familiar with the pharmacokinetic discussion let's explain maybe

232
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,120
trough and peak. How do we think about those dose. Yeah so when you give a medication to a

233
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,480
rapamycin pill when a person takes a rapamycin pill there will be a rapid increase in the levels

234
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,040
of the drug in the blood. And if they don't take another dose then the drug will start to get

235
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,760
cleared and it will go down. And so if you're taking a pill every day as soon as you take the

236
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,680
pill the blood levels go up and then it starts to get cleared and then the next day you take the

237
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,160
pill it goes up and then it starts to get cleared. So if you were to take the pill every other day

238
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,760
it would go down further before you get that spike again. So the spike the top of the spike

239
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,840
is the peak level the bottom before you take the next dose is the trough. And so the little bit of

240
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,000
data that's available and again there's not much data for different doses of rapamycin in people

241
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,400
who are not also taking other drugs. So the combination here is both dose and rapamycin

242
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,920
as a monotherapy. And so really the only study that I know of that looked at this really at all

243
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,440
actually didn't even use rapamycin they used a derivative of rapamycin called RAD001 or

244
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,720
Everalymus that's the manic study that we talked about. So there's really no good data in people

245
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,360
on different doses of rapamycin as a monotherapy in healthy people. So we're kind of stuck looking

246
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:34,600
at the data that we have. So in Joan's study with Everalymus or RAD001 they gave the medication to

247
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:42,680
healthy elderly people and they tested three dose and delivery combinations. So one of them was I

248
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,440
believe 20 milligrams once a week one of them was five milligrams once a week and one of them was

249
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:55,480
one milligram a day. Right and this was looking in the context of immune function as measured by a

250
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:02,120
flu vaccine response. So the outcomes were that I think at all three doses they saw evidence for

251
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,960
improved vaccine response which was consistent with prior data in mice that immune function is

252
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,560
improved by rapamycin. Pause for a moment that's still a bit counterintuitive to the layperson.

253
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,520
When I say the layperson I mean like the layperson who still thinks about rapamycin. Or actually lots

254
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,200
of physicians. Sure because we think of this as an immune suppressant and yet they took this drug

255
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,800
in monotherapy under a different dosing schedule than a transplant patient would take it and we saw

256
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,320
an improvement in their T cell function. The same cells that we tend to knock out in a transplant

257
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,880
patient. Right yeah so let's come back to that because that I think is that's an important issue

258
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,880
but it's complicated. Just to come back to the the trough levels and side effects so they saw evidence

259
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,800
for efficacy with every delivery method although they got I think the best efficacy at the five

260
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,480
once a week but they also had the lowest side effects and the most side effects were the ones

261
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,360
every day or the 20s once a week. I think it was in the 20s once a week but I can't remember for sure.

262
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,840
It was pretty comparable. So the first thing to say is none of the side effects were bad by

263
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,400
clinical standards. None of the people dropped out of the study because they were taking the drug

264
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,600
which is I think a pretty good indication for how tolerable the drug is. So even though they did

265
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,440
detect some side effects they really were not serious. They weren't even serious enough that

266
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,000
they were uncomfortable and people stopped taking the drug. So I think that that's really the only

267
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,440
evidence that we have that I know of that it's really the trough levels that drive side effects.

268
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,800
So I kind of think that's probably true but I'm not confident and I really think we need more data

269
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,560
to know for sure. It's certainly true in other classes of drugs and when you look at

270
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,440
gentamicin for example and the ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity it's a trough problem not a peak

271
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,160
problem. Right. That's why you have to make sure the patients clear it before you redose it.

272
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,560
So there's there are other reasons to believe that as well. Yeah. So now coming back to this immune

273
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,040
function question. There was a washout. There was. So there's a couple things again there to

274
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:10,360
consider. So the data suggesting that rapamycin can act as an immunosuppressant again is almost

275
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,360
exclusively based on very well I shouldn't say very high doses higher doses than were tested in

276
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,560
the Novartis study in people who are also taking other drugs that probably are true immunosuppressants.

277
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,760
Typically at least two if not three other drugs. That's right. So it's really not clear to what

278
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,360
extent rapamycin as a monotherapy in healthy people has immunosuppressive properties and the

279
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,280
data in mice I would say is mixed. It really seems to be the case then for some forms of

280
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:49,720
immune challenge at high doses rapamycin can enhance susceptibility to infection for other

281
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,520
forms of immune challenge it enhances function. But again those studies are almost always done

282
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,880
at very high doses of the drug that are even much higher than you would give to a person. So it's

283
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,800
it's an unknown. Now what seems to be the case both in mice and people is that short term

284
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,760
treatment with rapamycin in an old mouse or an old person followed by a two week washout where

285
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,600
they stop taking the drug when you then test immune function at least as measured by a vaccine

286
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:27,480
response you get a better response. So one model would be that the treatment with rapamycin is

287
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,640
restoring immune function in an aged animal probably through enhanced stem cell function

288
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,840
although I don't I think that that hasn't really been demonstrated clearly and you might need that

289
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,200
washout period if there is an immunosuppressive effect you might need that washout period to be

290
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,600
able to see that rejuvenation in immune function. Again that's really speculative though because

291
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,920
nobody's done. In Jones paper did they do I'm sure they didn't actually know that I think about it

292
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,040
they didn't have enough people in the study would have been very interesting to have seen the immune

293
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:06,040
challenge without the washout. Yeah they didn't do that. Now I was just going to say nobody's done it in either mice or in people.

294
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:13,000
That actually would be a fairly easy experiment to do in mice. The problem is you would never get an NIH study

295
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,120
section to fund that experiment because we already kind of know the answer that it that rapamycin works.

296
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,160
They wouldn't be viewed as an even though it's really important from a translational perspective

297
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,200
it wouldn't be viewed as innovative or important enough for somebody to fund a grant to do it.

298
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,560
So it's it's an unknown and I don't know how long it'll be till we actually get the answer for that question.

299
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:41,160
Now bringing it back to the dogs one of the challenges of course in leaping from mice to dogs is

300
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,560
mortality becomes difficult to study. You have an animal that lives a lot longer whereas mice you know

301
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:55,080
you can get a longevity answer in you know months if you select them correctly and dogs if you want to study them for true

302
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,160
heart outcome of you know death. So you pick a proxy. Well you can. Yeah yeah I'm saying I'm

303
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,960
saying like the shortest path would be let's look at organ function or something else. Right so what we did

304
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,240
so we've done one study where it was a 10-week study of rapamycin in middle-aged healthy companion

305
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,960
dogs and we chose heart function as our short-term measure and that again was based on mouse data where

306
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,120
two different actually three different labs now have shown that if you take a 20 to 24-month-old

307
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,080
mouse that's maybe the that's like a 40-year-old no it's more like a 60 to 65-year-old person

308
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,840
that if you just look at the heart of a 24-month-old mouse compared to let's say a six-month-old mouse

309
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,680
you can see declines in heart function just like you can in people and and the parameters that have

310
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,760
been studied with the respect to rapamycin specifically are mostly measures of left ventricular

311
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,720
function so ejection fraction fractional shortening things like that and this is done by echocardiography

312
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,760
so it's relatively non-invasive so you can see a decline in function with age and what what has

313
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,320
been seen now in three independent studies is that six to ten weeks of treatment with rapamycin is

314
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,280
enough to cause those measures of heart function in the old mouse to go back about halfway to what

315
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,160
you would see in a young mouse so it doesn't bring you all the way back to a teenager but it

316
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,880
gets you back to you know maybe a 35-year-old heart if you're doing the sort of mouse to human

317
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,600
equivalency and just to be clear that was how many weeks so the studies have varied is between six

318
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,960
and ten weeks all of them saw improvements it's not clear whether you get bigger improvements by

319
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,840
longer treatments so it's kind of in that range and did these animals also require a washout to

320
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,040
see the benefit no no washout so these are measures of heart function taken while the mice are still

321
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:51,640
on the rapamycin and these animals were dosed daily so yes all three of those studies used the

322
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,440
encapsulated rapamycin in the diet so they were getting the drug daily and it was not and this is

323
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,720
where it gets a little bit complicated because i'd say 85 percent of the studies on aging or age

324
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,560
related functional measures in mice with rapamycin have been done with an encapsulated form of

325
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,720
rapamycin in the diet we call it e-rapa and so that's different from a pill right because mice

326
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,440
are going to eat throughout the night so they're probably not experiencing exactly the same

327
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,920
pharmacokinetics that you would experience from a pill or the other kinds of experiments that

328
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,240
people have done in mice have been injections where you get you know this rapid peak in the drug

329
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,720
and then a pretty steep drop off as the drug starts to get cleared and nobody's ever done the

330
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,200
like the 24-hour measures of rapamycin blood level on the mice getting e-rapa so i don't know

331
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,440
how different it is but it's probably different in the sense that it's probably a more stable

332
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,240
level of rapamycin in the blood for a longer period of time i mean i would expect that the

333
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,640
e-rapa animals are going to have lower peaks and higher troughs i mean that would be that would be

334
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,600
the expectation yes but i don't know that anybody's ever really carefully looked at that so having

335
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,480
said that i think all three of the studies that looked at heart function in mice used the e-rapa

336
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,240
and it was a pretty low dose of the the how many milligrams per kilogram it's 14 parts per million

337
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,080
food i don't remember off the top of my head what that works out to in milligrams per kilogram

338
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,440
i feel like it's in the about the two range wow but much well yeah but again you have to you have

339
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,960
to keep in mind that you can't translate the dosing across species very well two milligrams

340
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
per kilogram in a mouse is not going to be the same as two milligrams per kilogram in a person

341
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,800
or it doesn't happen because the dogs and the humans i suspect are probably a lot closer than the

342
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,960
you would think so although i don't know that there's actually good evidence to

343
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,800
to support that so certainly in terms of body size if you're talking about a bigger dog they're

344
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,200
they're closer in terms of metabolism of the drug though that i imagine could vary it's

345
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,800
hepatically clear species i don't know that's a good question i'm pretty sure it's not really

346
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:01,720
p450 yeah it's if it's going to be in the liver so how did you ultimately come up with both a

347
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,960
dose and a schedule of delivery for your first trial so this again goes back to this question

348
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:14,440
that i was asking myself about can we do this safely and there's very little data in dogs on

349
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,080
rapamycin at all and just like in people there's almost none on rapamycin as a monotherapy in

350
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,280
healthy animals so i started you know basically digging and talking to as many veterinarians as

351
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,680
i could to find out what was known and i was very fortunate to actually be able to get in touch with

352
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:41,320
a veterinary group at the university of tennessee who was studying rapamycin in dogs who had had

353
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,880
hemangiosarcoma of the spleen and so they had done the pharmacokinetics and had developed a dosing

354
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,840
strategy that they feel is extending life expectancy in dogs who have had hemangiosarcoma of the spleen

355
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,080
and where they weren't seeing side effects and they had had some of their dogs on rapamycin for

356
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,760
more than a year so so we were pretty confident or i was pretty confident after talking to them

357
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,120
that if we took their dosing strategy that were unlikely to see any significant side effects over

358
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,920
a 10-week period and so i said that cardiac function was the functional endpoint that we

359
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,120
were using really the goal of that 10-week study though was to confirm this is a phase one basically

360
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,560
that we could do this that we could get people to participate they would actually give their

361
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,280
dog the medication and that we didn't see any significant side effects so i was pretty confident

362
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,440
that based on their dosing and delivery protocol we at least wouldn't see any severe side effects

363
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,800
in a 10-week period. Did the nih fund that study? Well not directly so we got a little bit of nih

364
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,480
money because we have one of these nathan shock centers of excellence in the biology of aging and

365
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,040
we had a small amount it was on the order of a few tens of thousands of dollars left over from

366
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:00,120
the prior year and so i asked uh Felipe Sierra who's the head of the division of aging biology

367
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,320
at nih if we could use that surplus specifically for this project and he was he was kind enough to

368
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,240
to agree to that but it wasn't we didn't write a grant and get a grant. But you sort of bootstrap

369
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,480
this thing. Yeah so actually i paid for this study mostly out of funds that i had gotten because i

370
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,280
was recruited to get a job somewhere else and as part of my retention package the university of

371
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,920
washington gave me some money that i could spend on whatever i wanted to and i thought this was a

372
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,800
good way to spend the money. So what did that 10-week study show? Right so first of all i'll go back

373
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,880
to the dosing before i tell you that. Oh that's right yeah yeah. So so i talked to this group the

374
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:42,600
university of tennessee and so their strategy was 0.1 milligrams per kilogram given three times a week.

375
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Okay. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and that made sense to me in light of the what we were just

376
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,800
talking about from the manic paper where it seems like if you give an extra day to let the trough

377
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,800
levels get down it made intuitive sense that that might also. Yeah you can reduce toxicity. Yeah so i don't

378
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,080
know that that's the case but but it made sense and so that was the dosing strategy that we went

379
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,080
with for our highest dose and then we also tested a dose that was half of that so 0.05 milligrams

380
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,600
per kilogram again monday wednesday friday. So we enrolled dogs into this study this was a very

381
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:22,120
small study all from at a private veterinary specialty clinic in the seattle area and so the

382
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,200
dogs had to be at least 40 pounds and at least six years old and they could not have any pre-existing

383
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,880
condition. So again this is a study of healthy aging we wanted healthy dogs coming into the

384
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,920
study. Six years old because at that weight range we figured that that would be you know roughly the

385
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,080
human equivalent of 55 years maybe big dogs age faster than small dogs so that's why we had the

386
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,520
weight criteria. So we wanted to have a population where we expected there would be the potential for

387
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:59,160
some age-related functional decline but that we wouldn't get a high proportion of dogs. Yeah you

388
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,920
don't be too close to the edge of the cliff. That's right that we're really sick. So one thing we

389
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:10,120
we found though that was unexpected was that about 20 percent of dogs in that age and weight range

390
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,680
actually have asymptomatic heart disease that you will see if you give them an echocardiogram

391
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,520
but you won't detect from a stethoscope exam and that was in hindsight it kind of makes sense right

392
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,040
again heart function is going to go down with age and where you decline like what is the clinical

393
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:33,240
threshold that we call disease is sort of a moving target sometimes right. If a vet with a stethoscope

394
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,400
takes a heart murmur and then they give the dog an echocardiogram and they see regurgitation they'll

395
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,480
call that heart disease. If they don't hear a heart murmur nobody's going to give their dog an

396
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,840
echocardiogram right it's expensive. Yeah and I'm not a cardiologist but I can't imagine the day

397
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,080
would ever come where using a stethoscope I could detect you know a low EF like to the tone of right

398
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,040
yeah I mean unless you would not get that no no it's really the regurgitation that they're hearing

399
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,080
as a heart murmur and and that was most of most of the dogs that we ended up having to exclude

400
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,000
we had to exclude because they had a pre-existing value of regurgitation that came out from the

401
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,440
echocardiogram but this was actually a discussion that we had to have with the cardiologist you know

402
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:21,080
the cardiologist initially went into the study with the feeling that if there's any regurgitation

403
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,240
that's beyond trivial that that's heart disease and so when we started to see dog after dog show

404
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,040
up with this level of regurgitation we had to have this discussion what's normal aging versus

405
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,920
disease right and right and so just because of the way that the protocol was written we ended up

406
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,880
having to exclude about 20 percent of dogs because they had underlying heart disease so so we had 40

407
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,000
dogs come into the study for their first exam that was our target number we ended up having 24 go all

408
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,720
the way through the study most three groups two doses plus a placebo yeah yeah and they ended up

409
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,000
not being evenly distributed and in part this was this was because in part is because it was my

410
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,080
first clinical trial that I'd ever done and I didn't didn't plan for the fact that we would

411
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,720
have to exclude as many dogs as we did so the way it ended up was we had eight eight placebo 11 high

412
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,120
dose and five medium lower dose yeah right that went all the way through we only had one dog leave

413
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,280
the study and that was because the owner just stopped giving their dog the medication and we

414
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,040
had one dog where the owner gave their dog the wrong amount of the medication which ironically

415
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,320
enough wrong in which direction low so the dog was randomized into the high rapamycin group and

416
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,320
ended up getting one quarter of the expected dose so other than that there was fantastic

417
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,360
compliance all of the owners did what they were supposed to came in for their exams so the main

418
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,720
outcomes of this study were one there was no evidence for increased side effects so the owners

419
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,120
filled out weekly surveys that there was a long list of the dogs didn't fill them yeah well you

420
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,560
never know there was a long list of did your dog experience any of these things and then there were

421
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,000
a couple of just open-ended questions you know do you feel like you observed any positive changes

422
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,920
or negative changes in health did the group in tennessee see the apthos ulcers in their dogs

423
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,480
because that seems to be i remember as a resident when we would give rapamycin

424
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,280
to the kidney transplant patients i mean the biggest complaint by far was those apthos ulcers

425
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,720
yeah and we didn't again in hindsight we we probably should have done a better job of looking

426
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,400
but we did not have any evidence that that that was happening the only thing that initially i

427
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,120
thought that maybe we were detecting that was because we had several owners then this was while

428
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,880
the study was still blinded so i didn't know which dogs were which at this point we had several owners

429
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,960
report that their dog was drinking a lot more water and a couple of them actually came in for

430
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,560
urinalysis and stuff like that and so i thought maybe that that could be like a dog's response

431
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,560
if they have sores on the inside of their mouth and they're uncomfortable maybe that would be the

432
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,120
sort of the canine equivalent of how they would respond to that as it turns out though when we

433
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,400
unblinded the study that reported observation of increased water consumption was equally spread

434
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,480
between the placebo and rapamycin group so i don't know if that's happening in dogs that's

435
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,240
something we'll look at in the next phase so again for all of the side effects though that we

436
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:23,400
surveyed owners on no difference between treated and untreated the blood chemistry showed no

437
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,800
significant changes with rapamycin which was actually a little bit surprising did you do a

438
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,080
glucose tolerance test we did not do any we did not do a glucose tolerance test in part because

439
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,400
we wanted to keep the the number of assays that we were asking the owners to subject their dogs to

440
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,680
as small as possible make it as non non-invasive as possible for the animals we did get blood

441
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,080
chemistry at at week you know before randomization at week three and at week 11 so within one week

442
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,640
of coming out of the study and we saw improvements in heart function now i will say it's a small

443
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,520
cohort they were on sort of a borderline of statistical significance so two of the three

444
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,560
measures that we had as our primary end points the three measures were ejection fraction fractional

445
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,960
shortening and e to a ratio and again that was just coming directly from the mouse studies two

446
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,640
of those three were statistically significant one was p value of 0.06 yeah but i mean you must

447
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,160
have been underpowered on absolutely anything absolutely yeah it's amazing you saw i agree i

448
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,480
agree yeah so i think the way i view this is it's it's about the most positive outcome that that we

449
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,000
could have hoped for clearly needs to be replicated but at least the changes are going in the right

450
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,440
direction and an interesting couple of interesting things when you actually look at the heart data

451
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,600
it very much looks like the dogs on rap mice and they got the biggest benefits were the ones that

452
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,480
started with the lowest function which is not surprising but that also is encouraging because

453
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,280
that's that's kind of what you'd expect right the dogs that have undergone a greater age related

454
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,080
decline are likely to be the ones that are going to get the biggest benefit from a treatment that's

455
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,480
actually affecting that so that was really encouraging and then we actually had one

456
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,440
doberman pincher in the study and this turned out to be interesting because doberman pinchers as a

457
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:18,040
breed are highly prone to dilated cardiomyopathy something like 60 65 percent of doberman pinchers

458
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,920
will develop dilated cardiomyopathy as they get older i wasn't really aware of this literature

459
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,440
going into the study um but it turns out that many doberman pincher owners will actually give their

460
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,480
dogs echocardiograms or electrocardiograms routinely as they're getting older to try to detect

461
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,640
dilated cardiomyopathy as early as possible and this the owner of this dog didn't tell us this

462
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,880
before she came into the study had actually been aware of this and was giving her dog

463
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,680
echocardiograms before coming into the study that dog had low cardiac function but it was not yet to

464
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,040
the point where it was clinically diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy so our cardiologist in

465
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:06,680
the study also not knowing the dog's history of of having prior echoes did not flag the dog as

466
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,480
needing to be excluded so the dog was randomized it just happened to be randomized into the higher

467
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,840
rapamycin dose and its function was that was one of the dogs where we saw the largest improvement

468
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,120
in function what is interesting about that is the owner then after the study was over

469
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,200
continued to get echocardiograms every three months and has shared that information with us

470
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,320
and so it's really it's an n of one but it's a really fascinating sort of case study because

471
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,680
you can see the dog's cardiac function declining then the dog comes into the study gets rapamycin

472
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,960
it shoots up it's quite a dramatic increase and then within about what was the increase in ef do

473
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,400
you remember i don't remember i don't want to say the exact number because i don't remember it sounds

474
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,280
like it was a big deal it was from the borderline of being a cult dilated cardiomyopathy up at least

475
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,720
10 10 percent 10 percent yeah 10 absolute percent that's right that's enormous yeah well

476
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,600
inked back into the normal range yeah and has that patient or that patient has that woman shared with

477
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,200
you what the resulting decline in ef has been since the trial so about i've got the data out

478
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,600
to about six months and and we're just now trying to reconnect with her to see if if she has

479
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,040
additional data that she'll share with us by about six months out the ejection fraction and

480
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,160
fractional shortening were back right at the point when the dog came into the study and at

481
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:29,400
that point her cardiologist diagnosed the dog is called dcm so so clearly going down the path to

482
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,840
dilated cardiomyopathy so the million dollar question in a study like that or in a case like

483
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:43,560
that is if you had to guess what would be the ideal way to take care of that dog to delay the

484
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,120
onset of cardiomyopathy as long as possible would it be just keep this dog on that dose three times

485
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,840
a week in perpetuity would it be give the dog a 10-week holiday 10 on 10 off 10 on 10 off right so

486
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,520
it's clearly 10 on every six months is just a seesaw if everything is working the way that

487
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,480
that yeah we think it is yeah my guess is that the default there would be to keep the dog on the

488
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,840
drug unless you start to see side effects right so so continue to monitor by echoes every three months

489
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,640
and unless you see side effects or unless you see something else that makes you worried that rap

490
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:23,880
my son is is having a negative effect just keep the dog on on the drug but you know it's an

491
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,080
unknown as to whether we would eventually see side effects at that dose because you know as I said

492
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,280
the only data that I know of is that university of Tennessee group yeah where they did have some

493
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,960
dogs that survived more than a year and continued to take the drug those dogs you know as I said had

494
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,520
had hemangiosarcoma of the spleen they'd had surgeries you know they were very sick coming

495
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,240
into that study and so I don't know even if there were mild side effects that you would really be

496
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,960
able to yeah to tease that apart from everything else that's going on with those dogs there are

497
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,600
other larger mammal studies that are going on correct with rapamycin specifically so there are

498
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,880
well so so there are research studies in the context of aging in marmosets they're very small

499
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,720
and and very early but but those are being done at the university of

500
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,200
san antonio yeah texas san antonio the bar shop institute and then there are a variety of cancer

501
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:24,360
studies in dogs with rapamycin so there's a large study of rapamycin for osteosarcoma in dogs and

502
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:31,880
then there are a few smaller clinical trials but I don't know of any other large animal studies in

503
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,920
the context of aging anti-agent yeah yeah now I want to obviously come back to the anti-aging

504
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,160
and the dogs but on the cancer topic there are some data that are actually suggesting

505
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,880
that the increase in autophagy that one might see with rapamycin which one would expect to see

506
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,680
at least with m torque one inhibition might be paradoxically not ideal in the active setting of

507
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,320
cancer right so I guess my first question is are you swayed by those data and if so

508
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,120
what would be the teleologic explanation yeah so I'll say I'm not swayed much I think it's I think

509
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,400
that those kind of data are important to be aware of I think one of the real challenges in the

510
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,680
autophagy field is that not everybody that we can't measure it well I was any one of them yeah

511
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,520
beside the fact that we can't we don't really know how to measure it I think as a as a community

512
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,480
we really don't know what we mean when we say that autophagy is increased or decreased different

513
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:41,000
people use different markers or measures for for autophagy so my view is that one of the things

514
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,680
that can happen not just for cancers but for lots of different pathologies is one of the ways that

515
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:56,520
cells try to deal with many different forms of stress in particular protein misfolding but also

516
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:03,000
other forms of stress is to turn up autophagy so I think that autophagy some markers of autophagy

517
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,320
going up can be a response to a pathological condition also what often happens is that

518
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,280
response of turning up autophagy does not lead to productive autophagy so you actually get an

519
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,080
accumulation of autophagosomes because they don't ever make it all the way through the process

520
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,720
and so depending on how you're measuring autophagy what you really might be detecting is a block

521
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,560
at the late stages of autophagy and what you're seeing is you're measuring a backlog that's right

522
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,800
so it's not necessarily the case that more autophagy is bad in that context it's the failure to

523
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,200
actually the through bring it through to completion and again I don't have a lot of data to support

524
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,080
this my intuition is that at least for some diseases one of the things that rapamycin does

525
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,000
and I don't really understand the molecular biology here it seems to alleviate that block

526
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,400
so you actually get productive autophagy working again and again I don't know exactly how that

527
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,760
works but that's what it seems to me is happening and so we have seen some evidence for this in

528
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,520
mitochondrial disease in the brain where if we look in the brain we can see these sort of massive

529
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,640
autophagosomes that are trying to digest mitochondria that can't do it while the disease

530
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,720
is progressing and somehow rapamycin fixes that so I think you have to be cautious in interpreting

531
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:29,160
an increase in autophagic markers in a disease as necessarily meaning that increased autophagy is

532
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,640
causing or contributing to that disease and it could be the case that depending on how you

533
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:39,240
activate autophagy it could be detrimental or it could be beneficial and so there's really two

534
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:47,480
different questions the first would be if you take a patient with cancer and you inhibit mTOR

535
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:57,640
is it not helpful because the tumor has already evolved so much to be outside of mTOR's purview

536
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,680
or is it it's actually harmful and that's of course separate from the option that could be helpful

537
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:13,560
right so my understanding of the clinical and the literature in humans is that for most cancers

538
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:20,280
once it's reached the point of diagnosis that rapamycin is disappointing in its effectiveness

539
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,000
it's not particularly effective that's not true for all cancers but for most cancers it has not

540
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,600
been as effective as you might expect given that we know that activation of mTOR is common

541
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:37,400
when you get high proliferation and then turning down mTOR should stop that. Turn off the proliferation.

542
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,360
Yeah so I think I think you're probably right that at least part of the story is that one of

543
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:49,720
the steps in the progression to cancer is evolving to ignore the break of turning down mTOR

544
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,760
so rapamycin may not be effective there. I think it's a complicated system though because the

545
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,440
effects of rapamycin on the immune system could have beneficial effects in terms of cancer or

546
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,560
detrimental effects so we know that immune surveillance is probably the most important

547
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,200
anti-cancer mechanism or certainly one of the most important anti-cancer mechanisms and we know that

548
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,560
immune function goes down with age that's probably one of the reasons why most cancers are age related

549
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,480
so if you can boost age-related immune function with rapamycin enhance immune surveillance that's

550
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,560
going to have a potent anti-cancer mechanism and again this is my guess my guess is that's why we

551
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:37,640
see in the studies in mice that cancers are pushed back during aging by rapamycin. On the other hand

552
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:42,520
if the dose of rapamycin is high enough that you're actually inhibiting immune function that

553
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,200
could be that could promote cancers and there's not a lot of data yet so we did one study in my

554
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,680
lab where we gave mice I think it's the highest dose that's ever been given in the context of an

555
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,960
aging study this was a daily injection of eight milligrams per kilogram so as we call it the party

556
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,640
dose yeah right right and so this was a study where we only gave the mice rapamycin for three

557
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:09,080
months so this was from 20 to 23 months and then we stopped the treatment and what was interesting

558
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,920
there was we got completely different effects in male mice versus female mice the male mice

559
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,400
lived 60% longer after the end of treatment they had better muscle function they got less cancer

560
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:28,040
the female mice had no difference in lifespan the mice that got rapamycin or didn't get rapamycin

561
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,040
but they died with I want to say from but it's hard to say for sure what a mouse dies from they

562
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,680
died with very different types of cancers so the female mice that had gotten this high dose of

563
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:46,760
rapamycin for three months all had aggressive hematopoietic cancers whereas about I think it

564
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,200
was about 30 or 40 percent of the vehicle treated mice so in black six that's not an uncommon cancer

565
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:59,160
to get but none of the rapamycin treated mice had non-hematopoietic cancers whereas like 60 percent

566
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,480
of the mice that didn't get rapamycin now the 2009 study that kicked all this off actually showed a

567
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,440
greater survival benefit in the female mice didn't it that's right so I think and again this is a guess

568
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,640
because I don't actually have the data to back it up my guess is that because we pushed the dose so

569
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:20,200
high we might have actually taken it too far in the female so one school of thought is that female

570
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,240
mice at least we don't know if this is true in any other organism female mice are more sensitive to

571
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,960
rapamycin and that could either be that they don't clear the drug as quickly or that for whatever

572
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,840
reason in female mice the same amount of rapamycin has a greater mTOR inhibitory effect but that's

573
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,240
one school of thought and I kind of think that's right so at lower doses of the drug you see a

574
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,560
bigger lifespan benefit in females than in males did you repeat that experiment at like four

575
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,600
megs per gig or something different we haven't we haven't we should so we did do we just need an

576
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,920
infinite pool of money I agree to do all of these like just to answer all these questions

577
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,120
figure out the most important questions yeah and I think the dose response is really important

578
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,480
we did do a lower dose for three months as well and there we saw increases in lifespan in both

579
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,520
males and females roughly the same magnitude so it was that dose was nine times higher than what

580
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:16,200
the ITP tested wow so one of the things that's interesting though is as you go higher in dose

581
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,400
so three times higher than what they originally tested the females still live a little bit longer

582
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,680
but the difference between males and females the gap has closed quite a bit so I think that females

583
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,880
for whatever reason at a given concentration of rapamycin are just more affected by that

584
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,120
amount of the drug and I think what we did in our high dose study is we just pushed it a little too

585
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:44,600
far we pushed it to the point where rapamycin did something probably to the immune system

586
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:51,000
that that allowed these immune cancers to to escape surveillance or become hyperproliferative and again

587
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,880
I'm not I'm not a cancer biologist I'm not an immunologist so I don't I don't have a good

588
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,120
feel for what the mechanism is I can tell you what the observation is and that's that all of

589
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,200
those animals had aggressive hematopoietic cancers when they got this three months of rapamycin

590
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,240
just out of curiosity more B cell or T cell do you recall I don't recall it's in the paper

591
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,200
we could look it up because there's an opportunity here to do the reverse right I mean there's an

592
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,840
opportunity to take right now we're seeing just an unbelievable amount of activity in adoptive cell

593
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,720
therapy and or even when you just talk about like checkpoint inhibitors and things like that like

594
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,640
it makes you wonder are there ways to make these things better maybe the checkpoint's the wrong

595
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,560
example because you might get more autoimmunity but but certainly when you talk about adoptive

596
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:39,160
cell therapy anything that could boost either you know cda function or inhibit the regs or something

597
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,600
there might be ways like it almost makes you wonder if using rapamycin in a different manner

598
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,160
in combination with immune-based therapy right might make more sense yeah no I think there's

599
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,480
a lot that could be done there for sure part of the reason why we haven't explored this

600
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,560
in more detail of one reason is again as I said I'm not a cancer biologist so it's not that's not

601
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,920
the thing I'm most interested in I think it's really interesting biology but it's not the thing

602
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,840
I'm most interested in but I also feel like because the dose that we gave was so high that again

603
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:13,480
thinking translationally about rapamycin as as a drug in the context of aging my feeling is that

604
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,640
what we've uncovered here is not going to be relevant at the doses that we would think about

605
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,360
giving to you yeah yeah yeah so that's why I haven't really spent a lot of my time trying to

606
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,240
figure out what's going on there but I think certainly in the context of cancer immune

607
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:35,640
therapies I think we do need to think a little bit more about how effective those kinds of therapies

608
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:42,600
are going to be in the elderly and maybe something like rapamycin could help could actually enhance

609
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,800
the ability of those I mean this question you posed when when David Sabatini Tim Farris and

610
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,920
Nav Chindel and I were in Easter Island a year ago over a year ago this might have been our

611
00:56:52,920 --> 00:57:00,760
favorite meal time discussion which is what best explains the increase in cancer incidence with age

612
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,120
being in other words what would the primary driver be the reduction in immune surveillance

613
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:12,440
or the length of time to accumulate mutations or the frequency of mutations like I mean yeah it's

614
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,440
not an obvious answer and I don't think it has to be just one no it's almost all those things are

615
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,520
working together yeah yeah I certainly over the last few years have come to think that the decline

616
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,880
in immune function is it's certainly more important than I had initially thought that that's my I mean

617
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,280
I secretly want that to be the biggest driver because I think we have a better chance to control

618
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,600
that yeah than some of the other ones and I think it probably is that would be my guess and I and

619
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:42,280
I also think it kind of makes sense that if you have an immune system that's functioning the way

620
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,480
it's supposed to you can actually deal with the mutation accumulation because your immune system

621
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:55,160
is going to clear those before they become yeah problems so now let's go back to the anti-aging

622
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:03,720
thesis right which is we're going to take healthy dogs eventually healthy people we want to reduce

623
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,280
the rate of decline is probably the best way to think about it right so we have a deterioration

624
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,080
in organ function okay all right one of the things that's been surprising to me again over

625
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,480
the last few years is the different ways that rapamycin not only seems to delay the decline

626
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:27,080
but it seems to make things better there clearly seems to be in at least some organs a rejuvenating

627
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,560
function and I suspect that's mostly stem cell mediated but again the mechanisms haven't been

628
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,720
worked out yet so we've already talked about immune function you can take an old immune system and

629
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:40,040
make it work more like a young immune system we've talked about cardiac function you can take an old

630
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,920
heart you make it work more like a young heart there's some evidence from David's lab that

631
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:51,080
intestinal stem cells okay can be rejuvenated by rapamycin we've recently published that alveolar

632
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,520
bone levels so in the mouth the bone around the teeth can be rejuvenated back to a more youthful

633
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:03,160
level by short-term treatment with rapamycin so there are now multiple different places in the

634
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:09,560
body at least in mice where you actually see functional improvements back to a more youthful

635
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,840
state and so I don't think rapamycin is going to do that for everything but at least for tissues

636
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,880
and organs where stem cell senescence plays a big role I suspect that rapamycin can have not just

637
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,480
an effect on delaying declines but actually bring things partially back towards a more youthful

638
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,040
functional state what's the best available evidence for that centrally in the cns

639
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:41,080
that's a good question so there are studies on cognitive function in mice showing that that you

640
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:47,720
can improve cognitive function in aged animals I believe at least one of those started the

641
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:53,720
treatment late in life and saw improvements in cognitive function and then in all of the major

642
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,840
alzheimer's disease mouse models you can the literature is a little bit mixed there's at least

643
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,520
evidence that you can wait until the pathology of the disease is set in you see the a beta

644
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,360
accumulated you see the functional deficits in terms of cognitive function you can start

645
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,800
the treatment and you can improve things and on post-mortem are you seeing an actual reduction

646
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,880
again yeah you are so I mean we haven't done this this is the work of several other labs in the ad

647
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,160
area yes so again the data is a little bit mixed so there are a couple of papers out there where

648
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,680
they they see that you can get really robust benefits if you start rapamycin treatment early

649
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,880
but they didn't see benefits in the ad models when you started late and then there are studies that

650
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:42,040
that did see declines in aggregation increased autophagy and functional improvements even when

651
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:47,560
you start like staggering if you could take an animal and ultimately of course a human who's

652
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:54,280
already accumulating ab and tau yeah and even just halting that is a big deal there's one drug

653
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,240
right in you know the yeah you're now you're going right into my biggest pet peeve right now

654
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,360
which is why there hasn't been or isn't a current rapamycin trial for alzheimer's disease but I

655
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,080
think you're right and I and again three years ago if somebody had asked me will rapamycin is it

656
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,720
likely to have any benefit in somebody who's been diagnosed with ad I would have probably said no

657
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:19,560
I come around to thinking that there's at least a reasonable chance that it cannot just halt

658
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,920
progression but it could actually make well especially if you you know one of our colleagues

659
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,800
is a neurologist here named Richard Isaacson and he runs the largest alzheimer's prevention clinic

660
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,280
in the country at Cornell you know Richard's thesis which I think makes a ton of sense is

661
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,240
again I think other people share this view is you want to catch people while they just have the

662
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,640
first signs of mild cognitive impairment sure absolutely and your ability to actually impact

663
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,720
them is enormous and and so the question is why aren't those people being considered for clinical

664
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,360
trials when we all already know that these other agents aren't really doing anything right yeah I

665
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:00,600
agree I think that if I was going to design a clinical trial for alzheimer's disease or dementia

666
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:06,120
with rapamycin that I thought had the best chance of success that would be the target population

667
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,960
those trials are harder to do in some ways because they're longer right and not everybody moves from

668
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:18,760
MCI to to full-blown AD at the same rate and we don't have at least my understanding is we still

669
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,880
really don't have great predictive biomarkers of how fast that's going to happen in an individual

670
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,720
but that would be the that would be the study that would have the best chance of working

671
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:34,200
having said that I still think there's a decent chance in somebody who's you know already gotten

672
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:40,040
to the point where where they will be diagnosed as having alzheimer's disease serious functional

673
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:45,400
deficits there's a chance that rapamycin could make things better now I get the practical reasons

674
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,440
for why people don't want to try a risky clinical trial it's expensive if you fail you know your

675
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,560
then your drug gets a bad reputation all of that so I understand why people are hesitant to do that

676
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,800
trial I think there's actually a pretty good chance it would especially if you can combine it I mean

677
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:05,720
I think you know Richard often talks about and and others do as well that one of our failures in

678
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:11,320
Alzheimer's is we consider it a single disease I agree it's as naive as saying John has cancer oh

679
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,720
well gosh that's the end of his life well don't you want to know what kind of cancer first or maybe

680
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,040
what mutation so similarly but broadly speaking and this is a gross oversimplification if you

681
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:25,320
consider the metabolic version of Alzheimer's disease the vascular version of Alzheimer's

682
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:31,080
disease and then the sort of toxin clearance impaired version of the disease to me I'm

683
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:36,520
generally most optimistic about the metabolic one so the variant of this disease that seems to be

684
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:42,200
mostly due to a failure of energy metabolism in the brain that also strikes me as the one that's

685
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:48,840
most amenable to certain systemic therapies as well right if you improve insulin sensitivity

686
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,880
if you improve glucose disposal if you reduce hypercordicillemia if you you can actually through

687
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,960
nutrition exercise sleep a number of other things start to modulate that that strikes me as the one

688
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,640
where you want to at least take your first shot at adding Rapa I think you're probably right

689
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:08,840
although again with Rapa mycen because we know that it is effective at for example turning up

690
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:13,480
autophagy it might also be it might work in the harder ones yeah that's a harder but I agree I

691
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,360
tend to agree with you I think that's a good point I also want to add that I actually think the

692
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,560
biggest problem with the way that the scientific community has thought about Alzheimer's disease

693
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:31,000
aside from considering it to be one disease is not really recognizing that it's a disease of aging

694
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,360
I really think that one of the reasons why the preclinical research has been disappointing at

695
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:44,280
developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease is because very rarely have people approach that

696
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:51,560
from the perspective that this is a disease of aging and so something that can affect the mouse

697
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:58,200
models of Alzheimer's disease when we create this disease in young mice may not work the same way in

698
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:03,160
in an in an aged person or an aged animal and that's one of the things that also makes me

699
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:09,640
optimistic about Rapa mycen is we already know that it hits the hallmarks of aging and it also

700
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,400
seems to be effective in these Alzheimer's disease models so that makes me think that it's acting at

701
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,920
a sort of a more fundamental level to target the molecular causes of this disease well especially

702
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:27,320
look I mean if you can regenerate a cardiac myocyte from its stem cell it's not an impossible

703
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,040
thought that you could regenerate neurologic stem cells absolutely and this is again an area which

704
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,640
which I mean 20 years ago we would have said that's impossible it's metaphysically impossible

705
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,520
right going back to the dogs for a moment I again I'm not familiar with dog literature

706
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:46,440
what is the fasting literature look like in dogs there's not a lot that I'm aware of either and I

707
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,080
think that kind of makes sense so you know first of all you have to differentiate the literature

708
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:57,880
in laboratory colonies from companion companion dogs there's probably not much in companion dogs

709
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:06,440
I don't know of true fasting experiments in like beetle so we can't use like the fasted versions as

710
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,600
proxies for what we would hope to see on the Rapa dogs which is the way they sort of did it in mice

711
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,920
right they sort of said well you know we know that if you calorically restrict this mouse

712
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,760
this strain of mouse under this degree of caloric restriction can expect as much of a longevity

713
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:26,440
boost and oh lo and behold rapamycin is probably even better than that right although from a

714
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,640
metabolic perspective I think it's still unclear even in mice whether rapamycin and caloric

715
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:37,240
restriction are working through the same mechanism and this is this is this is actually another area

716
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:43,560
where there haven't been a lot of good experiments done so there's a portion of the field that argues

717
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,040
strongly that that caloric restriction and rapamycin are completely different which to my

718
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,960
mind is absurd I mean we know that one of the main things that caloric restriction does is it

719
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,040
inhibits mTOR right and we know that rapamycin inhibits mTOR so they're not fundamentally

720
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:03,000
different so I think they are overlapping but distinct not everything that caloric restriction

721
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,680
does is going to be mimicked by rapamycin and vice versa having said that when you look at the gene

722
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:14,920
expression profile or the metabolic profile they don't look all that similar at least at the low

723
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,120
doses of rapamycin and so I think it's it's a little bit unclear you're right lifespan they both

724
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:26,440
extend lifespan rapamycin might actually extend lifespan across a broader genetic background

725
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,600
than caloric restriction but when you get beyond that I think it's still an unknown whether there

726
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,640
are you know say are there metabolic signatures that are common to both that might therefore be

727
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,560
more likely to be causal I think I think we don't know the answer so another what you're really

728
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:45,160
getting at is probably the next thought I had subconsciously which is could we use calorically

729
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:51,400
restricted animals to develop a metabolic signature as the gold standard for how we would then

730
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,600
titrate rapamycin both in dose and frequency I don't know of any evidence to support that

731
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,480
would be a stretch yeah I mean it might be possible but there just isn't much good data out there at

732
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:07,880
this point I do feel like if we want to put the resources into trying to identify predictive

733
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,400
signatures which I absolutely think we should do I think the the metabolome is probably the place to

734
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,920
to go and the serum metabolome makes a lot of sense so that would be where I would look

735
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:25,080
nobody's really done it well part of the problem is the data that's out there for rapamycin is again

736
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:30,840
all at that very low dose that the ITP tested originally we know that suboptimal for lifespan

737
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:36,360
it's quite likely that the effects that the lowest dose of rapamycin are having on metabolism

738
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,400
are going to be relatively modest compared to higher doses so you the changes might be there

739
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,600
but they might be so subtle that you're not going to detect them in a sort of high throughput

740
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,080
screening approach so so I think there's a lot we don't know but that would be where I would

741
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:58,440
put my effort in trying to identify serum metabolomic signature yep of rapamycin that

742
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,640
we could then correlate with the effects on function in a variety of different tissues as

743
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,640
well as life yeah because I mean I think as wonderful as it would be to just wave magic

744
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,160
ones and have biopsies of tissue it's just not going to be I mean we're not going to take

745
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,520
cardiac biopsies yeah right so you if you're looking for predictive signatures you can do

746
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,840
those experiments initially in mice but you really have to think about is this something

747
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,200
that's reasonable to do in a person or a dog and have you looked at the gut biome and the

748
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:31,560
dog at all a little bit so so we did a study in mice this was that that study I referred to

749
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,640
previously where we treated them for three months with either the high high dose or the the high but

750
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,560
not as high dose yeah and we did look at the fecal microbiome and we saw quite dramatic changes

751
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:47,640
there some of which are interesting and so that's that's an area that we would love to pursue I've

752
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,040
tried to get a grant to do that and so far haven't been successful through NIH but it hasn't been

753
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:57,080
done in dogs yet has not been done in dogs so we have a little bit of preliminary data from our

754
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:02,440
phase one study and we're seeing changes in the microbiome there as well so far the data that

755
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:07,960
we've got in dogs is not the sort of comprehensive metagenomic approach where we sequence everything

756
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,120
that's there it's more of a standard veterinary approach where they they have sort of broad

757
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,000
classifications of different types of microbes and there are definitely changes with rapamycin

758
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,280
it looks it's very early but it looks as though at least in dogs that have a a bad microbiome a

759
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,800
dysbiosis in their microbiome which can be defined clinically from this test there were two dogs that

760
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:35,080
we've looked at that started out with a bad microbiome they were in the rapamycin group

761
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,720
they were better by the end of the study obviously don't know if that's meaningful or not so so there

762
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,920
are changes in the dogs but it's really too early for us to know whether they look like the mice

763
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:50,040
and or whether that is going to either be predictive or potentially play a role in some

764
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,160
of the effects of rapamycin it is definitely the case though in both dogs and mice and i'm sure

765
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:01,320
this will be true in people as well that rapamycin has a large effect on the composition of the gut

766
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:06,760
microbiome i suspect that will also be true for other compartments in the body like the oral

767
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,400
microbiome maybe even the skin microbiome nobody's looked yet so that there's a lot to be done there

768
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,800
i also don't necessarily think that's going to be unique to rapamycin i think that lots of drugs

769
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,960
that we take yeah food will change that and absolutely diet and it's not clear if that's the

770
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,280
effect or the cause of it yeah so one of the reasons why i think that there's reason to think

771
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,720
that at least some of the changes in the microbiome could be causal for some of the effects of

772
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:35,240
rapamycin is that one of the things we saw in our mouse study was a pretty profound increase in a

773
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:42,680
bacterium called segmented filamentous bacteria or sfb in the rapamycin treated mice it turns out

774
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:49,880
if you look in the literature there are links between sfb and diabetes and obesity and also

775
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:57,160
between sfb and t helper cell maturation so it could be the the case that changes that rapamycin

776
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:03,800
is having on this specific bacterium as well as other bacteria are then having effects both on

777
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,360
potentially nutrient utilization and uptake but also direct effects on say immune function i mean

778
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:17,400
the intestine is an important immune compartment the bacteria are physically right there these sfb

779
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:23,160
actually form filaments directly associated with the intestinal cells so it certainly could be the

780
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:29,320
case that there are signals being sent back and forth that rapamycin is modifying by through

781
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,640
modification of the composition of the microbiome and that that's affecting immune function

782
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,040
adiposity all sorts of different possibilities so like i said that's something we're really

783
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,720
interested in in testing so there's like an infinite number of things i want to know right

784
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,520
yeah there's this company out there that's looking at duodenal ablation to ameliorate diabetes and

785
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,280
the data are actually really interesting so interesting in fact that when i first saw them

786
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,360
i thought this has got to be nonsense what's not clear is the durability and the economics of it

787
01:12:54,600 --> 01:13:00,520
just from a scientific standpoint they're doing these ablations of the duodenal mucosa and they're

788
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:06,200
seeing like immediate step function changes in insulin sensitivity arguing in fact that this

789
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:11,400
may be the mechanism by which the rue and y gastric bypass is ameliorating type 2 diabetes

790
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:17,160
it's basically taking this dysfunctional duodenum out of the loop and just saying we're going

791
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,160
jejunum to jejunum or you know stomach to jejunum to jejunum basically it's really

792
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,640
interesting so this is another area that i've gotten interested in and and we haven't really

793
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:32,120
dove into it yet much but i i think there is there's clearly uh literature growing in

794
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:40,040
all of the model organisms that with aging there is a decline in intestinal barrier function

795
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,800
and that at least in flies that seems to be causal for death so in other words it's strongly

796
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,240
correlated and there are ways every way that extends lifespan also seems to improve this

797
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:56,440
intestinal barrier dysfunction and i've been thinking and we have again a little bit of data

798
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:01,000
suggesting that rapamycin might actually have an effect on this age-related decline in intestinal

799
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,960
barrier function and why would a loss of intestinal barrier function be important well i mean one thing

800
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:14,200
that happens we know this happens is that you tend to see an increased level of microbial proteins

801
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:21,960
and dna in the circulatory system with age that causes a inflammatory response that may contribute

802
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,960
to the sort of systemic increase in inflammation that we see during aging so the loss of intestinal

803
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:34,200
barrier function may actually drive to some extent the inflammaging the increase in inflammation with

804
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:39,160
aging or at least contribute to it and so anything that you can do that is going to improve that

805
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,360
will potentially have an effect on systemic inflammation and that again could be another way

806
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:51,800
that rapamycin is sort of impacting the entire body in addition to the effects of rapamycin when

807
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,520
it gets to a cell and inhibits emitter in that cell and whether that's through changes in the

808
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,960
microbiome you know or changes in intestinal stem cell like zavatini has shown right there's lots of

809
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,240
possible ways that it could be working but i do believe that this decline in intestinal barrier

810
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:13,320
function with age probably is contributing to this sort of increase in in systemic inflammation

811
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,960
that we see during aging and there it's very clear that that happens in in people and in non-human

812
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,880
primates as well during aging now talking about people again i don't hold out much hope that

813
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:31,720
there's going to be an anti-aging trial in humans using rapamycin or a rapalog you know watching

814
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:37,160
how much difficulty it is to even try to get that study done with metformin which i mean is

815
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,920
about the most inert you know it's like you might as well just do it with drinking water right and

816
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,240
we're going to randomize you to seltzer versus flat water here so the real question is for the

817
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:51,000
people who want to be on the tip of the spear you're not going to have a gold-plated stamped rct

818
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,760
you're going to have to triangulate from everything else many roads point to your work and more

819
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:04,840
importantly what your follow-up work will look like right so again i realize that to try to secure

820
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:12,120
funding to do this from nih is slightly more complicated than trying to get bipartisan support

821
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:17,960
on health care but if we took the economics out of the equation if if there was a 10 to 20 million

822
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,960
dollar pool at the national institutes of aging said you know dr caberlin we want to we want the

823
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:30,920
definitive work on how to extend the life of dogs knowing that that's probably the best thing

824
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,800
we're going to get right towards humans what do those experiments look like right so so the study

825
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:43,400
that we want to do is a five-year study with rapamycin and and certainly this is scalable

826
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:49,400
right so so what we have designed is a study with rapamycin there are other interventions

827
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:54,040
coming down the pipeline that i think have the potential to be as effective as rapamycin so this

828
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,960
doesn't necessarily as long as you can do it safely in pet dogs yeah you can test any intervention

829
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:05,960
and one of the things that i am now convinced is owners are enthusiastic about participating in

830
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,120
these kinds of studies we've had more than 6 000 people sign up through our website with no

831
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,840
advertising at all to participate in the rapamycin trial in human clinical trials which i'm more

832
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,880
familiar with recruiting cost is a is an enormous cost it doesn't cost anything you get free

833
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,840
recruitment right right so having said that the study we would like to do is a five-year study

834
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:30,520
in dogs starting treatment at middle age so again the dogs would come in you know at least

835
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,160
six years old we might push that up to seven or eight years old and they there would probably be

836
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:41,160
a weight limiter like i talked about before because again big dogs age faster so let's just say 40

837
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:47,240
pounds six years old at least six years old so there will be dogs anywhere from six to 10 or 11

838
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:57,560
bring in 450 500 dogs or enough dogs to get 450 all the way through the study and look at not just

839
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:04,280
lifespan but lifespan is actually a really important metric here right lifespan is certainly

840
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,680
still the gold standard in the aging field if we want to convince the scientific community that

841
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,760
this is affecting aging it darn well better increased lifespan yep it's also important to

842
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:18,440
owners for obvious reasons and i think because as we talked about euthanasia is really what most dogs

843
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,000
die from because the dog gets sick enough that the owner and the veterinarian decide that it's time

844
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,480
to put the dog down yeah i think lifespan is actually a really good metric of health span

845
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,360
in dogs because most of the time that's not an easy decision right absolutely owners are not

846
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,520
going to put their dog down usually especially owners who want to participate in a study like

847
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,240
this unless that dog is really sick so i actually think lifespan is really maybe more important in

848
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:49,400
dogs as an outcome measure than it is in mice so lifespan is one of the key end points that we want

849
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:56,840
to look at and then we want to look as broadly as we can at functional measures of aging that we

850
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,360
know are important in dogs and so this goes way back to what we were talking about before what

851
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,320
do dogs get sick with as they get older so heart function we will definitely look at in part

852
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:12,040
because that's what our preliminary data yeah you showed that with a handful of dogs we have good

853
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:17,640
evidence that we can detect and expect to detect improvements in cardiac function activity so one

854
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,920
of the nice things about dogs is you can put a gps tracker on their collar and get very quantitative

855
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:29,560
measures of activity as the sensor technology improves it might be feasible to use a microchip

856
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,520
instead of a gps tracker on the collar to also get some physiological or just draw a fitbit on

857
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,120
their wrist you know yeah right well i mean that's really what the trackers are right of course but

858
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:43,080
it would be nice to get some physiological measures in sort of continuous real time if we

859
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,760
can so far the sensor technology isn't quite there at least that's my understanding but

860
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,360
well at least get activity and that'll give us a measure both of things like arthritis so dogs

861
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,960
that have arthritis are going to be less active and also muscle function and also how how well

862
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,120
are they feeling again a dog is more likely to be active if it feels well now obviously that's

863
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,040
confounded a little bit by whether the owner takes the dog for a walk but i still think total

864
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:10,040
activity is an important thing and is this a three group study in your mind so the study

865
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:15,320
that we're designing now is three groups it doesn't have to be but the three groups are a placebo

866
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:21,640
group uh short term group so six month or year long treatment and then the continuous treatment

867
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:27,640
group the reason for doing that again comes back to the mouse data in part because we as i mentioned

868
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:32,600
we've published that a short term treatment in mice is enough to give you large benefits on

869
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:38,280
lifespan and at least some measures of health and also because again as we're thinking about

870
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:44,840
ultimately bringing this to people it's easier to envision a transient or

871
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,600
intermittent treatment than it is a continuous for the rest of your life sort of treatment so it'd be

872
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:56,520
single dosing again that's the way we have the study designed now i can see a rationale for doing

873
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,960
three months on three months off or some some variation on that we felt that the simplest

874
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,920
thing to do first so you know it's always a balance between getting as much information as

875
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,720
you can from a study like this and doing things that are going to be where the complexity isn't

876
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,240
so great that it yeah your power analysis could give you a right so the design that we're working

877
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:23,000
with now is uh one year on and then the rest of the time off and so those so we'll get so you'll

878
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,640
have one group that's five years on one group that's one on four off and then placebo that's

879
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:32,840
right blinded across the board it's all going to be a randomized double blind trial right in

880
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:40,760
addition to lifespan and heart function and activity will track cancer incidence probably kidney

881
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,880
function get routine blood chemistry on the dogs probably every six months we'll ask the owners

882
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:52,680
owners to bring their dogs in get echocardiograms collect serum for metabolomics and feces for

883
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:58,440
microbiome so what would that study that you just described cost if you could complete so let's say

884
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,320
you had to screen 600 dogs to complete 450 which would actually be pretty good yeah attrition so

885
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:09,640
it would run about five million that's about the the budget for that study some of that depends on

886
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:15,080
what we can ultimately get the rapamycin for so because right now it's the street values about

887
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:21,000
the lowest we've been able to find is about seven dollars a milligram yeah now it may be possible if

888
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,320
we have a large study that we can identify a supplier that would cut us a deal for for less

889
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,920
but and the drugs are actually a pretty large amount of the budget yeah the veterinary costs

890
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,040
are the other large expenditure again the nice thing about companion dogs it's unlike a study in

891
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:40,840
mice in the lab is they live with their owners we don't pay cage costs and things like that

892
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:47,640
the other major costs are going to be for the analysis the analysis and also we need people

893
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,480
to be able to communicate with the owners retention will be important i don't think it's

894
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:58,920
going to be as hard as it is for some clinical trials just based on our experience even though

895
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:04,040
it was a short-term trial the owners that came into the short-term trial they were extremely

896
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:08,600
this will be easier than communicating with patients in a trial i think so yeah and there's

897
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,280
actually i mean it's kind of funny but there's actually data that dog owners are more likely to

898
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,280
give their dog a prescription medication than they are to take their own prescription medication so

899
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,280
we would not doubt that for a second so yeah so the owners that come into this study are highly

900
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,760
motivated and some of them are extremely disappointed after the study ends when they

901
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,960
find out their dog was in the placebo group so but there is a communication component to this where

902
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:34,120
we have to keep the owners engaged maintain communication we'll be sending out regular

903
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:38,520
surveys but needs to go beyond the surveys that would these all have to be dogs that live in the

904
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,640
northwest they'd have to be able to come in in fact they almost certainly would not be so the way that

905
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:49,400
we're planning the study now is that we will partner with five to seven veterinary schools

906
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,560
around the united states oh that's great and that actually there's lots of reasons why that's

907
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,920
that that makes sense right but veterinary cardiologists there's there's not a huge population

908
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,080
of veterinary cardiologists out there so if we were to try and do a study like this in the seattle

909
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:09,480
area i don't think that we have the enough veterinary cardiologists to actually do the

910
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,960
just the cardiology part of the study so fortunately you know veterinarians are very

911
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:19,560
enthusiastic about participating in projects like this and we have collaborators lined up at the vet

912
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,920
schools around the country so it will probably be five or seven sites obviously all of those sites

913
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:31,000
have to have veterinary cardiology but almost any major veterinary school is going to have that and

914
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,200
we prefer to work with veterinary schools that are in a suburban or urban area some veterinary

915
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,040
schools like like our school in the state of washington is all the way on the other side of

916
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:46,520
the state from seattle it's kind of out in the middle of nowhere so that makes it harder to get

917
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:53,160
owners to actually bring their dogs there yeah so our lead veterinarian is at texas anm veterinary

918
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:58,600
college and so she would be the head clinical person on the study and that would probably be

919
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:04,280
the site that the other veterinary sites coordinate with yeah well matt i could sit here and have this

920
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:08,520
discussion for another two hours it's fun stuff to talk about it it is and i really appreciate

921
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,920
your time and your insights i think the work you're doing is certainly what i would consider

922
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,720
to be among the bodies of work that are at that tip of the spear because i i guess i don't have

923
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:22,200
a lot of hope we're going to get the answer to this question directly i think it's going to be

924
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:29,880
an indirect triangulation of of data and and i think to be able to do this in companion dogs that

925
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:35,000
live in our environment is going to be a really important thing so let's see if we can get that

926
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,920
study done yeah i also want to i mean i think it's also important to at least note the impact of a

927
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,760
study like this would have on public perception right i mean i think in the absence of any data

928
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:51,400
and then the little bit of data we got from the phase one study the amount of media attention

929
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,440
that we've got yeah i've heard you on npr talking about this with tarry gross right has been huge

930
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:03,640
and so i tend to agree with you that it's going to be challenging to generate enthusiasm for a

931
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:09,080
double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of rapamycin for healthy aging in people challenging

932
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:14,520
is probably not even a strong enough word but i think we do need to or we should at least not

933
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:20,680
underestimate the potential impact if we're successful at accomplishing this in people's pets

934
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:26,760
that that will have on public perception as well as perception among the broader scientific

935
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:34,200
community i do feel like the field of aging research still has a bit of a reputation problem

936
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:39,880
among the broader scientific community part of that is historical part of that is because there

937
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,920
are some fringe elements that get a lot of attention but that aren't scientifically credible

938
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:51,400
i think that actually being able to show in dogs living in the human environment that we can modify

939
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:57,000
aging will have an impact not just on the public in terms of i'm sure we'll get lots of media

940
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,320
attention but also among scientists who might actually say okay aging research has arrived i

941
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:08,040
think that's happening already i think the tame trial has actually been mostly a positive in that

942
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,600
sense or the proposed tame trial i should say but i think we still have some work for the listener

943
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,200
the targeting aging with metformin yeah which is i mean i support that study i think that it's

944
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:23,720
probably the right first study in this area because as you've already said metformin we we

945
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:29,000
know that it's very safe at least as far as as a drug you might consider for a study like this

946
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,560
it's very safe there's very good human data suggesting that that diabetics taking metformin

947
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:41,400
not only have less diabetes but they have fewer other age-related diseases so i think the human

948
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,640
data is pretty compelling the downside to metformin and i think one of the reasons why

949
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:51,000
it has been a struggle to get that study funded is that i think there's a perception that we

950
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,800
already know about metformin it's not going to be completely surprising given the literature that's

951
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:00,680
out there if it does have relatively small effects on other age-related diseases and then i also think

952
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,560
it probably isn't going to have that large of an effect i could be wrong i hope i'm wrong but again

953
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:12,360
my view of the literature that's out there is that metformin probably has modest effects but

954
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:18,680
they're not going to be 20 increase in lifespan and rejuvenation of heart function and immune

955
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,960
function so yeah i agree so so i think that that's probably the downside to that study but but again

956
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:31,080
because we're also battling this perception of resistance to the potential for side effects when

957
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:36,680
you're talking about treating healthy elderly people that's probably the right way to design

958
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,200
this first study the other thing about the tame trial though is it's not being done in healthy

959
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:44,600
elderly people right the people that they're enrolling have to have at least one age-related

960
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:50,680
disease and it can't be diabetes so even that is really not the gold standard study that we'd all

961
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:55,960
like to see whether it's metformin or rapamycin or you know something else we've got some work to do

962
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,960
to get to where we can actually do that study and maybe the path forward is that you know as you

963
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:06,920
said individuals who are willing to kind of come together and do these sort of self experiments

964
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:13,800
if you can do it in a rigorous way where you're actually measuring the things that needs to be a

965
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:20,840
model system right that allows it so that if you and i and bob and rick and john do it we're you

966
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:27,160
know the downside to that kind of a model is that it's it's still going to be hard to convince just

967
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,960
the scientific community the way that it is no it's much harder to convince them that it's real

968
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,880
having said that if the effects are robust and you see it over and over and over and multiple people

969
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:42,040
we'll get there eventually so so that may be the path that we end up taking you know i'm not betting

970
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:48,040
on that path i'm betting on the path that you're describing as being the shortest distance between

971
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:54,680
these two points and i hope that as we start to do more of these studies in dogs and and also the

972
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:01,560
preclinical stuff in mice as we start to find functional measures that are improved over a

973
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,760
relatively short time frame that people will start to do some of these clinical trials that are

974
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:12,520
feasible in people i mean you could i mean novartis has already done it right you can do a clinical

975
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:19,720
trial where you treat healthy elderly people for six weeks eight weeks ten weeks and look at a

976
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,840
functional outcome and so if it's the case that rapamycin rejuvenates immune function and

977
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:31,080
rejuvenates cardiac function and and delays or restores alveolar bone levels in the mouth right

978
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:37,160
those are clinical endpoints that are impactful and could be studied in a short clinical trial so

979
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:42,440
we may get a few of those that will kind of build this body of evidence that rapamycin is having a

980
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:47,400
similar effect in people again the hard part is there's not a lot of money in rapamycin so i don't

981
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:52,840
know who's going to fund those trials that's the challenge so we we need to identify so either it's

982
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:58,520
going to be rapamycin derivatives that are under patent like novartis has developed and now rest

983
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,040
or bio is further developing or it's going to be alternative funding sources whether that's

984
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:11,160
foundations or wealthy individuals who recognize the potential impact of this work and are willing

985
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,800
to to fund a clinical trial to actually start to look at some of this. Matt thanks again this

986
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:19,000
is super interesting and best of luck with your continued work. Thank you.
