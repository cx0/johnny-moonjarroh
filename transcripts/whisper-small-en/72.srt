00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,560
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
on this podcast. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
I care most about professionally are how to live longer and how to live better. I have

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,040
a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally and

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,760
I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,120
team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example,

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,440
our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,560
natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,000
of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now, the

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,600
just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,640
nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,300
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,920
have proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,900
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,480
you can become a member. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
for free. It's that simple. It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,740
to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,440
full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon. These

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,900
are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows.

35
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:07,140
Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything

36
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,620
episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,940
these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,680
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,820
I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with

40
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,540
companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and

41
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,300
have them pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,260
is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,060
content exclusive for members. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,120
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,680
unfamiliar with Dan, he wrote the New York Times bestselling book, 10% Happier. He also hosts the

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,520
10% Happier podcast, which I've appeared on, and is the co-founder of the 10% Happier meditation app,

48
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,920
which by the end of this podcast, there will be no ambiguity about how much I love that app. In

49
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,780
addition to everything 10% Happier, Dan is also the co-host of weekend edition of Good Morning

50
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,060
America, and up until quite recently was the co-anchor of Nightline. I met Dan through a very

51
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,940
close friend of mine, and this is one of those times when I specifically just begged my friend

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,100
to make the introduction. I read 10% Happier almost the minute it came out in 2014, immediately

53
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,940
became a fan, and somehow I have spent the last five years stalking him, trying to figure out how

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,760
to get to know him, and eventually a friend of mine made the introduction. I talk a little bit

55
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,840
about that in the podcast about how much his work has had a profound impact on me, and just how

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,360
grateful I am for all that his journey into meditation has brought me. In this episode,

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,040
we talk about a lot of things. We do go into his story in a bit more detail about his upbringing,

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,580
and pretty quickly we get into the story of the breakdown meltdown slash crisis he had on

59
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,100
national TV in 2004 that ultimately began his journey that culminated four or five years later

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,820
with his discovery of meditation. What I really like about this episode truthfully is we get

61
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,340
into a lot of stuff that I've always wanted to talk about with Dan, and it's the exact stuff we

62
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,740
would have talked about over dinner. The fact that we got to have it in a podcast is exactly why I

63
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,600
have a podcast. I hope that you will find this discussion half as interesting as I did, and I

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,860
hope that for those of you who have not yet taken an interest in meditation, that maybe the topics

65
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,680
that we discuss here become the thin end of the wedge that at least get you to start exploring

66
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,360
a tool that I believe is one of the most important tools in the longevity toolkit. Without further

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,200
delay, please enjoy my discussion with Dan Harris. Before we start the podcast, I want to just make a

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,300
special announcement. As you're about to hear in this podcast with Dan, I'm a user and enormous

69
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,700
believer promoter of the 10% happier app for meditating. This is something that Dan and his

70
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,580
team have been working on for several years. I've been using it for nearly two years. I think it is

71
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:32,200
simply a remarkable tool, and I recommend this app and one other app, Sam Harris's app waking up to

72
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,740
any one of my patients who is finally willing to take the plunge and try mindfulness meditation.

73
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,480
Now, one of the things we wanted to do at the time of the release of this podcast was work with the

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,000
team at 10% happier to do a special subscriber discount code that's going to go along with the

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,480
podcast release. They were kind enough to do this at an unbelievable amazing discount, which is

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,480
available for only one week until September 30th. Now, they've also provided us with an ongoing

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,640
discount that will go on beyond September 30th. It's just not as much of a discount though. I still

78
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,640
think it's actually a pretty impressive discount. So if you're thinking about using this app or after

79
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,480
this podcast, you're thinking, hmm, you know, maybe I'll give this a try. This would be a great time to

84

taking any money to promote, sell, or have any endorsement of 10% happier. We are doing this

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,360
solely because I believe in this product. I love this product. And rather than have this company

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,160
or other companies pay us to advertise, we say take the money you would have paid us to advertise

87
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,400
and please pass that discount on to our subscribers. So thanks for listening. I hope you enjoy my

88
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:07,440
interview with Dan Harris. Thank you so much for making time on no less a Saturday morning to sit

89
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,960
here and talk with Well, I'm at work anyway on Saturday. But anyway, it's a pleasure. And this

90
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,880
is cool to be doing it in an awesome studio like this. I feel like there's some pretty cool stuff

91
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,720
that's probably happened in this area room. Yeah, I mean, you we are sitting on the second

92
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,360
floor of the ABC News headquarters and down the hall is where the late great Peter Jennings used

93
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,480
to work. I've had some traumatic moments on the floor. And I can't wait to dig into some of those.

94
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,040
He's definitely one of the most handsome people I've ever seen. He's a handsome dude. This is a

95
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,680
general statement of handsomeness. 007. Yeah. Well, I've wanted to have you on this podcast for

96
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,880
such a long time. I've wanted to meet you for a really long time, probably about from the day I

97
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,280
finished reading your book, which would have been a little over five years ago. I read your book

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,880
because I read your book as soon as it came out. In fact, I preordered it. And as I've probably

99
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:11,240
alluded to a little bit on the podcast before, it's really your book that was the first thing

100
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,120
that ever cracked the veneer of meditation is irrelevant. You know, that that sort of ethos.

101
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,600
And your book is really almost single handedly responsible for my interest in meditation. And

102
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,280
in some ways for where I find myself today, which is in a much better place than I was then. So I'd

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,800
like to almost just start with that the title of the book, 10% happier. I think it's just such a

104
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,560
beautiful title because it doesn't over promise. And it's just such a glib cute thing. And what was

105
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,840
the alternative title? The voice in my head is an asshole. Which is just as good, probably a little

106
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,920
bit better technically as a title, rather than just make you tell the whole story of the book,

107
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,600
take me back to the moment that started it. You've talked about this and I know you're tired

108
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,640
of talking about it, I'm sure, but maybe one more time. What was the moment when you realized all was

109
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,640
not well in Dan Harris land? I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to tell this story a

110
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,240
million times. So don't feel sheepish. The inciting event of the book, to put it in Hollywood terms,

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,880
was a panic attack. Not in this building. But at our studio in Times Square, where we do Good

112
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Morning America every morning. It was 2004. Warm June morning, I was filling in for Robin Roberts,

113
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,840
who was at that time, the news reader on the show news reader. We don't have this position anymore,

114
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,040
but it's the person who comes on at the top of each hour and reads off a bunch of headlines.

115
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,560
They've done a few big stories at this point. And they'll say, hey, you know, there are a few other

116
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,160
headlines bubbling. Let's get it over to Robin Roberts, or Dan Harris, who's filling in for

117
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,240
Robin Roberts, take it away. So I had done this a bunch of times. I was in a phase at this point

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,960
where I was filling in for Robin and also the main host of the show, Charlie Gibson, quite a bit.

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,920
They were giving me a shot. And for reasons I don't fully understand why it happened this morning,

120
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,480
I was a couple seconds into my shtick. I was going to read six, what they call voiceovers off

121
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,040
of the teleprompter that was 20 feet in front of me. So voiceover is I'm talking to the camera,

122
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,000
but they roll video over what I'm saying. And a few seconds in, I just lost the ability to breathe.

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,040
My palms were sweaty. My heart was racing. My lungs seized up. I just couldn't talk. My mind

124
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,320
was racing. And the more my body freaked out, the more my mind freaked out. And the more my mind

125
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,040
freaked out, the more my body freaked out. And I had to do something I'd never done before,

126
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,160
which was just quit right in the middle of the whole thing. And this is live. This is live. I

127
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,600
later found out that the audience was 5.019 million. And it was just terrible. I lied to the people

128
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,040
around me when they asked what had gone wrong. I said, I don't know. It's fine. And I was able to

129
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:10,320
come on an hour later and do another bit. So and if you look at it, it has a tons if you just Google

130
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,160
panic attack on live television, it's the first result. It has millions of hits. If you look at

131
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,920
it, it actually doesn't look that bad. I'll just say something about that. If you've ever had a

132
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,720
panic or high anxiety, it will actually it's a little triggering for those people. If you haven't

133
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,640
a response I hear from many people is, you know, it didn't look that bad, which is true. And the

134
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,720
reason if I recall, it was you were reading about either a new statin or a new drug. I recall.

135
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,360
Yes. It's been so long since I've seen it because I don't think I saw it. I watched it when the book

136
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
came out. Yeah. I was like, Oh, I wonder what he's talking about. And I don't have seen it in five

137
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,280
years. Yes. Well, no reason to go back to it. Unless you're me. If I hadn't had the luxury of

138
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:04,760
tossing it the baton back to the main host, then it would have been truly epic. Because I was unable

139
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,240
to speak. I would have had to rip the mic off and run away. But I was able to get out the words back

140
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,560
to Charlie and I and actually said back to Charlie and Robin when it was actually Charlie and Diane

141
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,120
Sawyer. That's safe. Really, it doesn't matter because it's not this isn't about the panic attack.

142
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,840
Yeah, it's not about what it's about what led to the exactly so even more embarrassing than the

143
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,440
panic attack, what caused it, which is that I had spent a lot of time in war zones. After 9 11, very

144
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,120
ambitious guy, and very idealistic. And I want to say fearless, but in the pejorative. I didn't

145
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,120
really think much about what the consequences of going overseas would be. And so I was in Afghanistan

146
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,240
a bunch of times Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, made a couple of trips to Iraq that all added

147
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,120
up to about six months, which spans the pre invasion, invasion, and then all the way up until the

148
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,520
insurgency started really cooking. And I came home in this period of time and I got depressed. And I

149
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,400
didn't actually know I was depressed. I was having trouble getting out of bed and I felt sick a lot.

150
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,880
But I didn't know I was depressed. A friend I was at one night going out to a party and a buddy of mine

151
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,080
offered me some cocaine. And I'd never I'd smoked weed and drank. Not really even to excess. But I'd

152
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,040
never had hard drugs. I was always really afraid of them. But because I was feeling like shit, I don't

153
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,880
know why I said yes, that night. And the cocaine made me feel better. Just like took it away. In

154
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,920
hindsight, I think it's pretty obvious I was depressed from coming home from the war zones,

155
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,640
not because I was traumatized, but because I missed the action. I liked it. And I was in withdrawal

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,280
from the adrenaline. And the cocaine was a synthetic squirt of that adrenaline. And it made

157
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,080
me feel better. Obviously didn't last that long, which is a hard lesson every coke user has to

158
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,600
learn. And if you haven't used coke, I recommend you don't. Well, how does that relate to the panic

159
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,840
attack? After I freaked out, actually happened to me twice. I went to a doctor here in New York

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,160
City who's an expert in panic. He asked me a bunch of questions. One of the questions was, do you do

161
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,240
drugs? Which at this point, you're thinking that would never even register as a potential college.

162
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,920
I even know I make this joke all the time was when I said, yeah, I do drugs. He gave me a look. And

163
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,520
the look communicated the sentiment of okay, asshole, mystery solved. I wasn't a heavy cocaine

164
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,320
user. I was intermittent. It was only on the weekends. I wasn't high one on the air or anything

165
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,480
like that. It was just I partied once in a while. He was like, that's enough to change your brain

166
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,720
chemistry and make it more likely for you to have a panic attack. So that was a big aha moment. And I

167
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,920
quit doing drugs, started seeing him frequently. And that was really the beginning of me making a

168
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,400
change. And I want to talk so much about what came of that. But I also want to kind of dig into a

169
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,080
little bit of what got you here because I think there are a lot of people out there. I mean, I've

170
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,760
had patients who have done a lot of cocaine or have done some cocaine. And, you know, many of them

171
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,560
still don't experience what you experience. It may not be in life, Talib. That's right. They may not

172
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,200
have the same provocation or the same stress that can produce that phenotype. But I want to kind of

173
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,320
go back to something that's maybe even at the root of all of that, which was what was the void,

174
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,800
maybe is the wrong word, but what was the itch you were trying to scratch? What was the rush that you

175
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,440
needed throughout your life? I mean, you I could never do what you do. Let's start with that, right?

176
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,280
Like, I could never put myself out the way someone in your position puts themselves out. It's kind of

177
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,840
an amazing thing that you can talk to so many people every night, you know, like, every day or get your

178
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,040
start in this whole space of news. So in college, I remember you writing about how you, you know,

179
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:02,280
you worked at a local news station, right? You get this big break to come to ABC. You're getting a

180
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:09,040
dopamine hit every time you do something good, right? Do you have a sense of what that dopamine hit

181
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:19,800
was numbing? Because I do think that on some level, cocaine, perfectionism, performance, sex,

182
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,880
all of these things can numb. Have you ever read the book by Gabor Matei in the Realm of Hungry Ghosts?

183
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,600
I haven't, but I the Hungry Ghost is something I think a lot about. It's an ancient Buddhist idea.

184
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,040
Yeah, I believe that's where he borrowed the title for the book. And as you can imagine,

185
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,360
he writes a book about addiction. But what I love so much about the book is he does a great job of

186
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,840
making the case. He's a psychiatrist, and he mostly treats patients who are, you know, on skid row in

187
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,040
Vancouver. So usually opiate addicted. But you read the book and you come away realizing, wait a second,

188
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,200
you could be a high flying news anchor, you could be a, you know, Wall Street tycoon. You're an addict,

189
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,360
too. So the person on skid row, for them, the opiate or whatever drug of choice is lighting

190
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,520
something up in their cortex. It's a pleasure center. But you can get that from so many different

191
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,000
things. So I guess what I'm getting at in a long winded way is, when do you think your addiction or

192
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,640
your junkie ism started? Was your career choice in any way driven by that, which I would think for

193
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,320
most of us on some level it is? Yeah, I have been trying to think about this quite a bit recently,

194
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,240
because I don't think I've really satisfactorily answered it in 10% happier. I don't think that was

195
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,120
really the point. Maybe I should have and or maybe I shouldn't have I don't know, either way set it aside.

196
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,160
Just one point that's sort of adjacent. When you talked about Gabor Maté's work, I have a friend,

197
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,440
Dr. Judson Brewer, who actually might be a good guest for you. He's a neuroscientist, formerly

198
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,800
of Yale now at Brown. He's one of the lead neuroscientists in the fascinating push to figure

199
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,400
out what meditation does to the brain. But Jud is also an expert in addiction, and he actually treats

200
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,320
people clinically. He wrote a book published by Yale University Press called The Craving Mind,

201
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,640
but his initial title was, We're All Addicted. So it really goes to the fact that you don't have

202
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,560
addiction. These are my words, not his. And I don't know if he would have blessed them. But

203
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,840
what I take from what he's saying is addiction is a spectrum. You may think you're not an addict

204
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,560
because you don't have a needle hanging out of your arm, but that needle hanging out of your arm

205
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,600
is just the extreme end of the spectrum. But we're all addicted to lots of things. What's your

206
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,400
relationship with your phone? What's your relationship with professional success? What's your

207
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,400
relationship with sex, shopping, gambling, drinking? We are rats in a maze, and we go where the pellets

208
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,640
are. Yeah. And for the first time ever when I read Mathe's book, which I think I read in 2016 or 2017,

209
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,040
there was a moment in when I realized those of us with the socially acceptable addictions

210
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,880
actually have a disadvantage. If there's one advantage to having a needle in your arm,

211
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:17,080
at least everybody realizes it's wrong and you're more likely to do something about it. But if you're

212
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,920
a perfectionist, if you're a workaholic, you're getting a lot of attaboys before someone comes

213
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,120
along and says, let's examine your relationship with this thing. That's an excellent point.

214
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,640
So what drives me? What makes Sammy run? You know that book? There was a moment when I was a kid,

215
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:41,480
my parents were both academic physicians. And very prominent. I mean, your mom especially.

216
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,720
Yeah. My mom was one of the editors at the New England Journal of Medicine. She's just about to

217
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,000
retire. My dad was chief of radiation oncology at the Brigham and Women's. I'm one of the pioneers

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,880
in radiation therapy. But academic medicine doesn't pay that well. And we lived in Newton,

219
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,280
Massachusetts. And I was really keenly aware of the fact that we were much poorer than a lot of

220
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,120
the kids that I went to school with. My dad drove like a shit brown Plymouth Valiant and my mother,

221
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,920
a very bland Chevy Chevrolet or something like that. And we had a nice house, but it wasn't that

222
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,160
nice vinyl siding. And yet I knew one of my friends lived a couple doors down from

223
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Subner Redstone. And interestingly, I also had a lot of, Newton's a pretty big city. So I also had

224
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,360
a lot of friends who lived in public housing. But it was the rich people that kind of got in my head.

225
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:42,120
And I felt insecure about that. I also remember during this period, my parents somehow took us on

226
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,200
a trip to Europe. And it was all paid for because they were going to give a few talks, lectures at

227
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,120
various institutions around Europe. But we were also going to turn a lot of it into vacation.

228
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,000
Most of the time we stayed in like not very nice places. But when we went to Paris, we stayed at a

229
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,760
really fancy hotel that whatever local institution they were speaking at put us up at. It's called

230
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,720
the Hotel Regina. And it was really fancy. And it was the first time I'd ever been to a really fancy

231
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,440
hotel. How old were you? I think 10 or 11. And I remember thinking, this is how I'm going to live.

232
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm not going to live like the Schmucks, who didn't keep the heat on in the winter. You know,

233
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,640
we all had to wear like down vests around the house because they were so intent. They're so flinty.

234
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,360
They were so intent on saving money. And I think there was something in I don't want to say it's

235
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,400
not as simple as just saying it was the Hotel Regina that did it. But that to me seems like a

236
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,600
defining moment. The other thing I think that's going on that only really started to get clarity

237
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,960
on recently is I have an executive coach who I actually mentioned to you. Yeah, I mentioned to

238
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:53,000
you when you came on my podcast. This guy's name is Jerry Colonna. And Jerry is an executive coach,

239
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,720
but he's not interested in productivity hacks, or how to get your next promotion or how to manage

240
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,320
your inbox. He is really interested in like what's your what are the primordial wounds in your life?

241
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,840
What's your five year old logic that is happening in the backdrop of your adult life and many ways

242
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,400
controlling you like a malevolent puppeteer, but that you don't have visibility on. He tries to

243
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,320
help you see sort of like what are these characters in your head that are that have so much power over

244
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,880
you, especially when you don't see them. And he often talks about the fact that as a young person,

245
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,560
there are three primary needs we have love, safety, and belonging. And when I first heard him say that,

246
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,920
I said, well, that's that's bullshit. I don't mean that's pretty much my reflexive reflexive response

247
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,560
to anything. You're a healthy skeptic. Yes, I'm a healthy. No, I'm a well, I'm a skeptic. Sometimes

248
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,120
it's healthy. Anyway, so he's talked about love, safety, and belonging. And I don't know, Jerry's

249
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,160
got a way that sometimes I have to reject his first foray for a while before I accept it. But

250
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,200
over time, I started to realize that safety is actually something really important for me.

251
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,640
There is such a thing as intergenerational trauma. My great grandparents escaped the Cossacks.

252
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,880
Another great grandfather lost his family's meager fortune and put his head in the oven and killed

253
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,240
himself in the family kitchen. Lots of alcoholism, depression, poverty, fortunes lost and made and

254
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,720
lost in my family tree. You know, my dad's an inveterate worrier. So is my mother really,

255
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,440
if I'm being honest, I think that the desire for I never felt unsafe in the home. But I think the

256
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,880
world has always felt unsafe to me. And having been raised during the Cold War, which freaked

257
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,920
me out so much that I had to go see a shrink when I was a little kid. I think part of the drive is

258
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,160
the self protection. You mentioned one of your grandparents who had a pretty impressive temper

259
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:55,880
was that a grandfather? Yeah, Robert Johnson. So my maternal grandfather, he was raised in some like

260
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,640
shitty farm in upstate New York by an abusive really abusive father.

261
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,480
Was smart, though, when I got to got into Middlebury, and then got married a girl at Middlebury.

262
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:15,560
And it was smart enough to get into Stanford to do a graduate degree in history. He was going to

263
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:22,360
become a history professor. But he had a kid, my mother. And then he had another and another

264
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,280
and another ultimately five. And they didn't have housing for kids at Stanford and he couldn't

265
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,600
afford to go otherwise. And basically live the rest of his life. In business. Yes, not only them,

266
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,320
but the world he became a middle manager at the Yellow Pages. Remember what the yellow pages were

267
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,640
they said the big Bible of telephone numbers that used to show up on our doorstep once a year.

268
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,600
And he was part of the part of that team, but not a particularly successful part of that team,

269
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,640
really embittered and took it out as kids and was a bully with them slapped them in the face,

270
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,080
figured out what their weaknesses were and exploited them in public. And I remember when

271
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,720
I was a little kid, he came in one day, I came to his house and he took me into his living room to

272
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,400
show me his VCR and said, if you touch this, I'll break your arm. Like that kind of guy.

273
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,800
Fascinatingly in his eighties, he became very nice. He got a computer and he was really into

274
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,240
Twitter and email and he would email all of his grandchildren. And so this big radical change came

275
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,960
over him later in his life. Did you ever get to talk to him about what precipitated the change?

276
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,440
No, I didn't dare. So he's still alive? He is not alive. I don't know how he would have taken that

277
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,880
question. Didn't strike me as something that would be safe to ask.

278
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,240
Have you ever talked with your mom about him and his impact on her life and maybe what she's

279
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,840
transmitted of that to her kids, either directly or indirectly through trying to avoid patterns?

280
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,680
She definitely, I think both of my parents tried to, my dad's parents were quite kind,

281
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,040
but they had flaws of their own. I think both of my parents had this idea that they were not going

282
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,200
to repeat the mistakes their parents had made. And they were really good parents. But recently,

283
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,000
I've been talking to my mother more about her relationship to her father because I'm writing

284
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,280
a book about compassion and kindness, which are two words that most men don't want to talk about

285
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,000
much. And they're just kind of, to my ears, kind of, I'm almost slightly embarrassed to have them

286
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,520
past my lips. But I think there's going to be a way to talk about this stuff that can be more

287
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,040
attractive and aspirational because we clearly need it. And we need it as human beings, we need

288
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,280
it as a culture. For me, it's important to understand my mother's relationship to this guy

289
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:44,120
because I see so much of him and me. So I got to reckon with it. You have a brother and a sister?

290
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,960
Or just a brother? Just a brother. Yeah. Did any of that get transmitted to him in the same way?

291
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you feel, does your brother have, feel that he has some of his grandfather in him?

292
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:00,760
I don't think so. My brother's a pretty menchy guy. He's just widely beloved. He's a pretty

293
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,120
prominent venture capitalist. And within that community, which I now know better as a startup

294
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,920
co-founder, his reputation is just, people really like him. He's got a wide, wide circle of friends

295
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,400
and is very, just kind of relaxed and affable. My wife has referred to him as the nice Harris.

296
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:28,440
So I don't see, he's got his own stuff. For sure. We all have stuff. It's not the kind of stern,

297
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,080
authoritarian vibe that I can emit. So I want to come back to the story, but I want to

298
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,600
sort of go off on one little tangent for a moment. You said that the words kindness and compassion,

299
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,760
you almost feel a little uneasy when they pass your lips. Or you said something to that effect.

300
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,960
Why is that? Because I think this, the words are encrusted in so much cultural stuff, like cliche.

301
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,120
I don't know that we found a great way to talk about kindness and compassion. It's Hallmarky,

302
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:11,640
ooey gooey, meaningless cliche, or it's bland, dogmatic, exhortation, figure wagging,

303
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:19,960
God is watching type of stuff. It's not often sold to us the way it can actually be sold to us,

304
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,040
which is in terms of our own self-interest. There's a lot of evidence that shows that

305
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,560
people who are compassionate are happier, healthier, more successful, more popular.

306
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,600
And it feels good on a moment to moment basis. It feels good. We are wired to get

307
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,640
feel good chemicals released into our brain when we're good to other people. Just by way of an

308
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,120
example, what does it feel like when you hold the door open for somebody? If you're mindful in that

309
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,000
moment, if you're awake, that feels good. Well, that is infinitely scalable. Not to the point

310
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,760
where you have to be an idiot or be a doorman, which I love my doorman, they're definitely not

311
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,600
idiots, but they can do that job, which is great. I'm glad they do it, but they could do lots of

312
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,600
other jobs. The point isn't the holding of the door. The point is that you can. My meditation

313
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,120
teacher has a great little rule that I've been trying to operationalize, which is if he notices

314
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:22,360
the impulse to give something a rise, he does it. So how many times during the days the impulse to

315
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,200
like, maybe I could compliment somebody on her shoes or his shoes, but you don't do it for one

316
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,960
reason or another. Or you know, you should send that note to that person just to say they did a

317
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,720
great job on something or walking down the street and you know you got two bucks in your pocket,

318
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,320
but you don't really want to make eye contact with a person standing outside of Starbucks asking

319
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,680
for money. No, actually, just do the giving. Why? Not because you're rah, rah, just trying to make

320
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,680
the world a better place, man. Do it because it feels good for you. And by the way, yes, it will

321
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,840
make the world a better place in lots of unpredictable ways. But my sales pitch here is that,

322
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,640
and I wrote a chapter about this in 10% Happier called the self-interested case for not being a

323
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,080
dick. And that's just a jokey way of putting it because it's me struggling with how to talk about

324
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,880
this incredibly important subject in a way that avoids all of the cliches that have made it so

325
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,360
meaningless to so many people. We all kind of vaguely want to be nice or we think we're good

326
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,240
people. We've thought about it. We certainly want other people to be nicer, but I don't know.

327
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,680
There's only one self-help book that I can think of that's been successful about compassion. And

328
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,520
that book does not advertise compassion on its cover. The book is called How to Win Friends and

329
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,480
Influence People. And if you read it, which I happened to recently do, it's actually a book

330
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,880
about compassion that's been kind of inspirational for me and thinking about like, how can you find a

331
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,320
way to talk about these things in a way that people will actually listen? You know, it's so

332
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,480
funny you bring this up because just by total coincidence, I think yesterday, the meditation

333
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,200
I did in your app. So for the listeners, if you haven't figured it out by now, which means you

334
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,920
haven't been listening to my podcast, which is fine. I still forgive you. But Dan is the co-founder

335
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,880
of an app called 10% Happier, which along with another app that I've talked about a lot waking

336
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,600
up are really the cornerstones of my meditation practice. And I've probably also talked, you've

337
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,240
probably heard me talk about Joseph Goldstein. Jeff Warren is a couple of the teachers that I really,

338
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,760
really like in this app. And I think it was just yesterday I did a lesson. I think Joseph, I'm

339
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,640
pretty sure it was Joseph. And it was talking about how even your physical characteristics change

340
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,440
in a moment of conflict, choose to do the kind thing versus the not. So sure enough, I do my

341
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,240
meditation in the morning, I go to the gym in San Diego, I have the luxury of working out at home,

342
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,440
which I love because I can be alone. I'm kind of alone. But in New York, I go to a big crunch gym,

343
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,720
right? Which always puts me in a little stressed state because I'm that guy who likes to be able

344
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,480
to control everything. And I want to be able to do a circuit between these two machines back and

345
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,000
forth, back and forth. So sure enough, I'm doing that. And I'm using a machine. But when I'm off

346
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,400
the machine, another guy sits down at the machine. Okay, no problem. I'm a civil enough guy to go up

347
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,080
to him and afterwards say, Hey, do you mind if I work in with you? But he says no. Like, I'm going

348
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,000
to sit on this machine until I'm done. And I don't want to trade. I don't want to share with you.

349
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,840
And I said, you realize it's a machine, we ought to do a switch the pen and he goes, yeah, but I

350
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:36,280
don't want to. Now again, old Peter, or maybe normal Peter, that would turn into an escalation.

351
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,400
But I had just listened to this meditation that Joseph had done that day about how my

352
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,880
external manifestation could change if I could be kind in that moment. And I said,

353
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,160
okay, no problem. I'll wait till you're done. I just walked away and did something else.

354
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I really thought about it for the next three or four minutes. And sure enough,

355
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,080
a I stopped being upset about it very quickly. And this is going to sound crazy. But within about

356
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,520
five minutes, I felt bad for him. I started thinking, Oh, he probably feels like a jerk now,

357
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,040
because I haven't put up any fight. I've been very kind and pleasant. And I'm worried about him. I'm

358
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,880
worried that this guy is over there thinking to himself what I'd be thinking if I were in his

359
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,720
shoes, which is why didn't I just share with this guy? So you're right. Let's be completely

360
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,600
transparent. This is total self-interest. Yes, I just want to feel better. I'm just tired of

361
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,640
feeling ashamed of myself. That's right. This is not me making this up. The Dalai Lama, who's got

362
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:42,360
a reasonably good pedigree on the issue of kindness and compassion, says that there is a

363
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,080
kind of selfishness that's called wise selfishness. And it's the ultimate form of selfishness.

364
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,560
It is to be kind, because you will be happier. And there's all this data to suggest not only

365
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,640
would be happier, but also healthier and more popular as I was saying before. Nobody tells us

366
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:09,000
this. And that's why this is the book I'm working on now. And my ideas are not fully formed. So

367
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,880
you're hearing me speak kind of early on before I have my shtick down, which may be good, maybe

368
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,360
bad. I don't know. We'll have you back when the shtick is ready. But I like pre-shtick discussion.

369
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,440
The pre-shtick? Yeah. Well, I mean, maybe I'll figure things out by just talking to you about

370
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:32,360
it. But I really think we are on some levels, we are selfish. So I'm trying to, we don't generally

371
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,560
do things unless there's a, back to my rats and amazed analogy, unless there's a pellet in it for

372
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,680
us. And I fear that the way kindness is discussed is like the care bears or some religious figure

373
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,720
in Robes Wagon, his finger at you. That doesn't strike me as scalable, especially at a time where

374
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,320
we really need this. We've got epidemic levels of anxiety, depression, suicide, especially among

375
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,920
young people. And we have epidemic levels of political polarization. We've got global problems

376
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,760
that require cooperation like climate change. This is the time where we actually need to start pulling

377
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,320
our heads out of our asses. So I'm excited to see if I can make a little contribution in this way.

378
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,560
How much of understanding this concept you've described, do you think requires understanding

379
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:27,080
its counterpart? So, you and I've spoken before about this idea of the numbing effects of anger

380
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,600
and grandiosity, which in the short term are incredibly numbing. I mean, they are beautiful

381
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,520
anesthetics for sort of the maladaptive mind. Kindness and compassion are antidotes to that.

382
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,720
Do you think it's necessary for a person to understand the nature of their addictions,

383
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,440
their shames, their drives to these other counterparts to kindness and compassion? Or do

384
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,360
you think you could say, no, look, you never need to explore those things. You never need to understand

385
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,280
those things. You don't need to start exploring the relationship you had with your grandfather

386
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,920
or your childhood. And instead you can just focus on the behavior change one interaction at a time.

387
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,080
Well, I'll speak for myself. I think for myself, it's been very important to explore it.

388
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,000
And it's useful. I mean, it's like, you got to figure out the pain of holding onto the hot coal,

389
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,800
which then it feels really good to drop it. So for me, seeing both the psychological content of,

390
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,720
you know, exploring my relationship to my grandfather, etc, etc, but also the moment by

391
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:35,080
moment mental processes, what it feels like to suffer right now, really help you reorient.

392
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,880
The fact that it feels good. There's an expression about anger from the Buddha that I think is

393
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:49,640
useful, which is that he said it has a honey tip, but a poison root. I think the prerequisite for me

394
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,800
for seeing that is mindfulness. So in other words, having self-awareness, mindfulness is just the

395
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,680
ability to know what's happening in your head at any given moment without getting carried away by

396
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,400
this is a skill that we developed through meditation, but there are other ways to do it.

397
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,640
But I think meditation is the cleanest, clearest way to, if you have a couple minutes a day of

398
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,560
meditation, helps you have more visibility on your own inner weather. And then you're not so yanked

399
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,840
around by it. And I think having that mindfulness on board can show you that anger sucks. It feels

400
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,720
bad. It may feel good if initially it's a good release of energy, but then it's in your system

401
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,360
for a while. It takes a long time to detoxify. And same with the grandiosity. It feels off to

402
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:43,080
be toot your own horn as much as somebody like me is prone to do. I feel now that I've got enough

403
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,880
meditation on board and just like it doesn't feel good when I'm being braggadocious or even subtly

404
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,160
self-promotional. It's not even that. To me, they're really dangerous grandiosity because that's so

405
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:06,040
obvious. Is the grandiosity when I'm in the line at the airport and the TSA guy pulls my suitcase

406
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,640
out of the line because of no reason apparently at all and decides to take 20 minutes to come and

407
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,120
check out what's in it so that that means I don't get to buy lunch before I get on my flight. It's

408
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:24,760
the I'm so much better than you. Why don't you get over here and do your job? I'm doing my job. Do you

409
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,200
know how hard and you're not saying any of this to anybody, but you're thinking it right? Like,

410
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,120
do you know how hard I work? Do you know the effort I put into my job? Why don't you work as hard at

411
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:41,400
what you do as what I do? And that's the grandiosity that I think is the absolute poison. And I just

412
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,720
think if I'm going to be brutally honest with myself, that's the biggest struggle that I have

413
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,400
is that inner one-upmanship. And I mean, I love that expression about anger. I completely agree

414
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,040
with it. And I, you know, my therapist has shared that one with me many times. And it's,

415
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,920
you know, we're going to talk a lot about meditation, but you're absolutely right.

416
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,440
Mindfulness is what has even allowed me in the moments of anger to realize what the half-life

417
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,920
is of the honey. I read a tiny bit of a book called Assholes, a Theory. And it was like a kind

418
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,920
of an academic treaties on assholes. And it said the quintessential asshole rallying cry is,

419
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,120
don't you know who I am? Yeah. And again, you may never utter those words. I don't think I've ever

420
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,600
uttered those words. You know, they've never come out of my mouth, but I've thought them. Oh, yeah.

421
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,800
Me too. And the half-life of the honey is so short. And the shame that follows actually

422
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,280
precipitates the following grandiose act. Like that cycle is so vicious. That's good that you see it.

423
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,880
And that's really important. Seeing it is huge.

424
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,920
So let's go back because we're going to jump around a lot, but we go back to the meltdown.

425
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,240
Fast forward. Your therapist finally gives you the aha moment.

426
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Your start, and I assume that he's helping you come to the grips with,

427
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,800
Dan, you're a bit of an addict, right? You're addicted to the high of your job, which is

428
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,760
soothing you. It's soothing something. Let's put aside for the moment what's being soothed.

429
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,880
What was the next step in your evolution to exploring this? Let me do the following. I know

430
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,040
there's so much we want to talk about that we won't get into it. I'll just tell the listeners that

431
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,760
unrelated to all of this, you'd been given an assignment at work, which was to sort of

432
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,920
explore and probe the growing religious movement, something that you didn't find remotely

433
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,480
interesting initially, but being the good soldier you are, you're sort of going through this. And

434
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,080
is it safe to say that the work you'd been doing in understanding religion created kind of an

435
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,960
opportunity for you to also start exploring the spirituality of mindfulness? Is that a fair?

436
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,280
I'll let you finish it in more eloquent terms. Sure. I mean, the assignment was given right

437
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,880
here on this floor on the second floor of ABC News. Was it Peter Jennings that gave the

438
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,880
who made me cover faith and spirituality, which I did not want to do as raised in the People's

439
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,080
Republic of Massachusetts, not particularly interested in this kind of stuff. I like to

440
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,080
tell the joke about the fact that I did have a bar mitzvah, but only for the money. So it was not

441
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,000
on my radar as an important subject. But it ultimately was great for me because first of all,

442
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,840
I learned a lot about faith and spirituality, which was I was totally ignorant on the subject.

443
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,640
And I made a lot of new friends. And I just brought me into parts of the world that I

444
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,480
wouldn't have otherwise seen. And it also ultimately brought me to meditation. In particular,

445
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,040
it came in the form of a self help writer named Eckhart Tolle. One of my colleagues here at ABC

446
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,120
News recommended that I read one of Eckhart Tolle's books, because she thought maybe he would be a good

447
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,600
story for us. And I read the book and I thought at first I was reading the book and I was like,

448
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:05,240
this is fucking bullshit, like really hardcore. Just awful. And Oprah had basically anointed him.

449
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,400
Oh, yeah, she talked about how she did this whole she had him on the show and then she did a whole

450
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,520
digital series with him. And then she told everybody that she'd put copies of his books

451
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,920
in every bedroom of every house she owns. And then Paris Hilton was seen carrying one of his

452
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,440
books when she went to jail to do time for DUI. Like there was a whole moment there in like 2006,

453
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,160
2008, where Eckhart Tolle was, you know, making a big... He was the guru. He was the guru.

454
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,960
And I was, you know, I react poorly to all of those kinds of things. And his writing has a

455
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,480
lot of grandiosity in it. He talks about spiritual awakenings and how he had a spiritual awakening.

456
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,240
And then he lived on park benches in a state of bliss for a couple of years in London. And

457
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,080
he talks about vibrational fields. There's a lot in there not to like if you're me.

458
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,520
I have to be honest, I couldn't read the book. It's the first time I tried.

459
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,360
Because even though and looking, I should go back and reread it now. But at the time, at least,

460
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,840
this sort of metaphysical nonsense, just, it was just too much. Like I just couldn't,

461
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,520
it became such a barrier to entry. I agree completely. It reads better to me now.

462
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, I suspect it might as well to me. But what he does do when he's lucid is just

463
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,240
describe our inner lives in an incredibly incisive manner. He talks about how we have

464
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,080
an ego, by which he's not talking about the way egos used in our culture now is like,

465
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,840
Oh, yeah, that guy's got a big ego. He's a jerk. But he means that we all have this running

466
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,000
dialogue, this inner narrator, this voice that chases you out of bed in the morning,

467
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,640
and he's yammering at you all day long. And it's just blah, blah, blah, all day long,

468
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,040
thinking about the past or thinking about the future to the detriment of whatever's happening

469
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,320
right now. Our mutual friend Sam Harris has this joke, but when he considers the voice in his head,

470
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,520
he feels like he's been hijacked by the most boring person alive who just says the same shit

471
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,680
over and over. Most of it negative, all of it self referential. And Tolle's argument is when

472
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,680
you're not aware of this nonstop conversation, it owns you. That to me was incredibly powerful,

473
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,000
first of all, because it just seemed intuitively true. And second, because it described or it

474
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,680
explained the most embarrassing moment of my life, my panic attack. The voice in my head was why I

475
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,480
went off to cover wars without thinking about the consequences came home got depressed, was

476
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,600
insufficiently self aware to even know it, and then blindly self medicated. And it all just blew up

477
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:41,160
in my face. So that was reading Tolle's book was incredibly powerful. My problem with Tolle,

478
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,320
and I did ultimately do an interview with Toronto, if I recall, your hometown flew to Toronto and

479
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,800
interviewed the man. And first thing I asked him was, it was interesting to me because this is the

480
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,440
first time my whole covering with a religion beat where I felt like I had skin in the game. I was

481
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,240
really excited. You wanted to know I wanted to know wanted what this guy had. By the way, I didn't

482
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,880
think he was full. I didn't think he was a charlatan. And I had interviewed many charlatans. Yeah.

483
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,960
But he was weird. Yeah. And frustrating. The first thing I did is I said, well, you know, what do you

484
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,000
do about the voice in the head? Clearly, you're saying something that seems to me to be indisputably

485
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,200
true, except for I don't. Yeah, what do you how do you actually tame it? You acknowledge that there's

486
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,280
a jerk sitting in the corner. How do you make him stop talking? There's no practical advice in the

487
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,080
book. So I thought he maybe would be able to reveal his wisdom to be in person. And the first

488
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,400
thing he said was, take one conscious breath. And the voice in my head was like, what the fuck does

489
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,600
that mean? What are you talking about? And I asked him a bunch over and over and over. And he

490
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,040
just didn't say anything that made sense. I like I understood the individual words he was using,

491
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,600
but not in the order in which he used them. So I left that interview quite frustrated.

492
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,360
I noodle in this interest of time, I won't go into too much detail, but I spent a little bit of time

493
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,800
noodling around in the self help world generally. Your story about Deepak is pretty awesome.

494
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,000
To me, at least that one's my favorite. So Deepak and I started hanging around a little bit. And

495
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,720
I like Deepak. Deepak is actually more relatable in person than Eckhart Tolle. But Deepak talks in

496
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,920
this way that's like, it literally makes no sense. He used, he casually used the term with me one day,

497
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,400
the transformational vortex to the infinite. That's just the kind of shit he just says.

498
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,160
All the time. So he was just even more confusing. And I definitely didn't believe he was

499
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,360
enlightened because he was checking his phone all the time. And, you know, in nonstop,

500
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:43,640
in perpetual motion, always hustling. Which, by the way, I don't say as a criticism, I really

501
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,880
liked him. But he just seemed as miserable as I was in terms of professional desire, at least

502
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,480
Eckhart Tolle seemed like blissed out. Anyway, I ultimately realized and Deepak helped me realize

503
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:01,000
that the mechanism one can use for taming the voice in the head is meditation. And I was not

504
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,520
positively predisposed to the idea of meditation because I felt like it comes with some baggage.

505
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Yeah, I mean, it was, I often say it was, it is the victim of the worst marketing campaign for

506
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,880
anything ever. Because the traditional artwork shows people, you know, sitting in an impossible

507
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,720
position, floating off into the cosmos. The rest of us sit to meditate and either we're in a bunch

508
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,640
of pain or we're noticing that we're distracted. And we don't feel at all like that. And therefore,

509
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,000
we think we're failed meditators. In fact, the experience of meditation is this constant

510
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,320
humiliation, where you sit, you try to focus on one thing at a time, usually it's the feeling

511
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,960
of your breath coming in and going out. And then you're distracted over and over and over again.

512
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,800
But the game in meditation is simply to notice you've become distracted. And in the moment,

513
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,520
that you notice you've become distracted, throw a little party for yourself, because you are waking

514
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:02,200
up from the automatic pilot, the daydream of your the hallucination of your life, this constant

515
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,880
discursive thinking, and then you're actually here now paying attention. And so the whole game of

516
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,920
meditation is not to stop thinking, which is impossible, it's to notice when you become

517
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,120
distracted and start again and again and again and finding out that the process was that simple,

518
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,120
and that there's an enormous amount of science that strongly suggests that it's really good for

519
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,920
you. I don't want to overly hype the science because I think that it's still in its early

520
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,840
stages, but it really certainly looks like a little bit of meditation every day can do quite a bit good.

521
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,320
And that is what got me over the hump to start. Have you read the book Altered Traits? Yes.

522
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:45,160
I think that that book does such a great job explaining that we don't meditate for the state,

523
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,400
we meditate for the trait, and that's hard to explain to people until they actually try it.

524
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,200
There's an app out there, there are many, that are tracking your heart rate and your heart rate

525
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,120
variability and levels of calmness during meditation. And I've tried these apps and come

526
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,320
to the realization that at least for me they don't make any sense, because I don't find meditation

527
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,040
generally to be that enjoyable. Sometimes I do, by the way, like we talked about how I'm fasting

528
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,920
this week. Something about fasting makes meditation really amazing. It sharpens the mind.

529
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,400
Yeah, there's just a much deeper connection. But there are many days when my meditation is

530
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,680
very difficult. It's really hard to do everything that you just described.

531
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,840
So that's the state, right? It's not a blissful state at all. But what I'm interested in is,

532
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,560
let's say if I meditate for 20 minutes in a day, I'm not meditating for those 20 minutes,

533
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,080
I'm meditating for the other 23 hours and 40 minutes. Those are the traits that I want.

534
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,840
And therefore, to me at least, an app that was helping me assess the change in my state

535
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,760
during 20 minutes is not nearly as interesting as a reflection on how is this going to help me act

536
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,680
the next time the TSA guy seemingly singles me out, which of course is a ridiculous thought.

537
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,960
But you know what I mean? I've always found this distinction helpful. And by the way,

538
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,680
going back to the whole drug thing, I view the entire distinction on drugs to be somewhat

539
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,520
arbitrary, right? Like is cocaine generally a drug that is good or bad? In my opinion, very bad.

540
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,040
Why? Because it's a drug that only impacts your state, but not your traits in a favorable way.

541
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,080
So it gives you a positive state and then a negative set of traits in the long run.

542
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,280
Have you ever been around somebody doing coke? It's not that positive sometimes.

543
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,640
Oh yeah, fair enough.

544
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,240
They're pitching you on new business ideas.

545
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,120
Yeah, they've got this awesome new cat food idea. It's the best cat food.

546
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,680
Conversely, when you look at things like psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, which is not

547
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,840
technically, I mean, sort of a quasi-psychadelic, but I think these drugs plants, for maybe lack

548
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,800
of a better word, when done correctly under these therapeutic settings are remarkable,

549
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,520
not so much because of the state, which they clearly alter, but much more because they can

550
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,840
change the traits outside of them, which is something, by the way, the authors of altered

551
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:08,200
traits argue against. Their view is that meditation is the only way to use the state to change the

552
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,440
trait, but that's sort of another issue. So kind of listening to you talk about that, I realize

553
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,720
this is a distinction that it can't be stated enough to someone who's new to meditation,

554
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,400
which I'm hoping some people listening are, because it's easy to get discouraged.

555
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,920
It's music to my ears to hear you say that. Richie Davidson and Danny Goldman wrote that book.

556
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,600
They actually sat in the chair you're sitting in. Now you're, we're doing this at ABC News

557
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,560
in the room where I record my podcast and they've both been on my show many times together and

558
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,960
separately. And I think it's an excellent point. And it's what trips up so many meditators, because

559
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,040
they sit to meditate and they think they should feel a certain way. And then they conclude that

560
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,040
they're failures because they're not feeling a certain way. But the point of meditation is not

561
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:01,080
to feel any specific way. It's to feel whatever you're feeling right now, so that you learn how

562
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,400
not to let your feelings push you around. And yes, of course, the real world application of that is

563
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,880
that you're better at life. We don't meditate, as is often said, we don't meditate to get better at

564
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,720
meditation, meditate to get better at life. Now, just to be clear, though, over a period of time,

565
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,160
as you and some people get to this point and some others don't. But if you're getting to the point

566
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,720
where you're starting to get actually quite serious about the meditation practice, at some way,

567
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:36,040
actually might want a teacher because getting better at the meditation itself actually can have

568
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,520
lots of benefits. That doesn't mean the meditation is going to be fun. It just means that you can

569
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:47,400
technically understand the nuances of your own mind and the nuances of various practices at differing

570
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,280
levels. And that I think can have a positive effect on your practice and on your life. And

571
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,920
it creates a kind of a virtuous cycle. I'm getting ahead of myself here. The thing to know primarily

572
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,320
for meditators is don't get hung up on feeling calm or blissful or anything like that. Just

573
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:11,800
tune in on your ability to see clearly whatever's happening right now. But if what is a distraction,

574
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,720
is it knee pain, is it an itch, whatever it is, pleasant or unpleasant, because what we're

575
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:23,080
training over time is the ability to notice that anger has come upon us off the cushion in our

576
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,960
regular lives. And can you resist the urge to say something that's going to ruin the next 48 hours

577
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,640
of your marriage? That's where the rubber hits the road. It's so powerful. And I kind of remember the

578
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:41,640
first time I was able to see the train coming before it hit. It still hit, to be clear. I wasn't

579
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,000
able to stop the train, but the fact that I realized, oh, the train started over there and

580
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,800
it rolled there, bang, versus always just seeing impact, impact, impact. The glass half full

581
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,840
approach of that realization is, okay, maybe the next time you could slow the train down.

582
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,400
And what if one day you could stop the train, the train hitting something being a metaphor for the,

583
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,920
you actually saying that thing that's going to nuke that relationship. Let's pause for a moment

584
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:16,760
and explain the distinction maybe between mindfulness and being present. I believe my

585
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,520
children, especially the two little boys, are very present. I don't think they're anywhere but

586
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:29,080
in the present. I absolutely don't think they have a shred of mindfulness in them.

587
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,120
How would you explain that distinction to people?

588
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,960
The way my meditation teacher, Joseph Goldstein, talks about it is like a labrador.

589
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,840
It's not dissimilar from a four-year-old.

590
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,880
I have a four-year-old boy myself. You look at a labrador, she or he is pretty present.

591
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,520
Which is to say they're probably not thinking about what they're going to eat tomorrow and

592
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,760
they're not thinking about the dog that barked at them yesterday.

593
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,600
Yes. They're not a lot in neuroses. They're not swept up in brewing past decisions or fretting

594
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,600
over the future or whatever. They're just right there doing whatever, eating the kibble,

595
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,760
sniffing some other dog's butt, chewing your sweat socks, pooping on the rug.

596
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,320
They're right there for all of that. Being present is necessary but not sufficient for

597
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,840
mindfulness. So you need to be present. But then there's a metacognition that also happens,

598
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:20,600
which is you know that you're in the present moment and you know that you know you're in

599
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:27,000
the present moment. We are classified as homo sapiens sapiens, the one who thinks and knows

600
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,720
he or she thinks. And that second sapiens has atrophied over time because nobody bothers to

601
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,160
point out to us that we're capable of this. We have this ability to step out of the stream of

602
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,160
our consciousness and notice, yeah, there's I'm having all these thoughts. I'm having all these

603
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,840
urges. I'm having all these emotions and to not be carried away by them. And by the way,

604
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,040
you're not going to step out of the stream forever. Like you can just do this for a nanosecond at a

605
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,480
time and just to see quickly, oh yeah, I'm having all of these racing thoughts. That's homo sapiens

606
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,560
knowing and knowing that you're knowing. Dogs can't do that. Your boys can, but it's not very

607
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:12,600
well developed. Mine can, but we'll get them to work on it. My son last night was aggressively

608
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:21,560
for 10 minutes trying to get me to smell his socks. And he was like, daddy, they don't smell

609
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,120
that bad. I'm telling you the truth. I'm like, dude, you're lying in how I know this because you

610
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,320
have the same face I have and I'm looking at it and that's how I lie. And yeah, it was like karma.

611
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,400
My wife was dying because I'm always messing with my wife. It's one of the hallmarks of our

612
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,200
relationship and me just kind of being a jokester with her. She's like, this is karma. Your son is

613
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:48,200
you. So what was your first foray into a mindfulness based practice of meditation?

614
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,760
So in this period of time when I was checking out Eckhart Tolle and Deepak, my wife gave me a book

615
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,200
by a guy named Dr. Mark Epstein, amazing human. Who you've had on the podcast twice, I believe.

616
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,800
Yeah. And he's a real friend. I read the book and I realized, oh wow, everything that I liked

617
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:11,400
about Eckhart Tolle was lifted without attribution from somebody known as the Buddha. Epstein's books

618
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,640
are all about the overlap between psychology. He's a practicing psychiatrist here in New York City

619
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,960
and he's written these beautiful books about the overlap between psychology and Buddhism. I didn't

620
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,840
know anything about Buddhism, but it was very clear that all the stuff about the voice in the

621
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:31,160
head, which the Buddha refers to as the monkey mind, really is thousands of years old. Much of

622
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:36,280
this philosophy honed by a guy heretofore known to me as a lawn ornament. But the Buddha is a

623
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,000
fascinating guy and really, really smart. And the Buddha that you're talking about is actually kind

624
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,880
of different from the big bellied lawn ornament, isn't he? Isn't he different entities altogether?

625
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,120
The big fat guy is known as the laughing Buddha, I think. Okay. That's not the Buddha. That's not

626
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,880
the historical Buddha, but there are plenty of you go to a spa that probably have the skinny one.

627
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,880
That's the Buddha, but they didn't make any representational art of the Buddha until hundreds

628
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:10,920
of years after he died. When did he live? He lived 2,600 years ago. So 600-ish BC and lived where?

629
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:17,480
India? I think he was born in what is now Nepal, but then was all over India. And talk a little

630
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:25,000
bit about his path, what we know. What the legend is. Because again, we think there was a guy named

631
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,040
the Buddha, but what's been passed down to us is quite sort of mythological in terms of his

632
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:36,840
biography. So we know his name was purported to be Siddhartha Gautama. And he was born according to

633
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:43,000
the legend into, he was the son of a king. He was a prince, like a kind of a minor king. And his

634
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,320
mother died in childbirth or shortly thereafter. And some wise man told his father, this kid's

635
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:57,240
either going to be a great ruler or a sage. And the father really did not want him to be a spiritual

636
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:02,920
leader. He wanted him to take over the job of being a king. And so built this world for him

637
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:10,920
where he would be not exposed to any suffering. So just, you know, fanned by palm leaves and fed

638
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,720
whatever the best cuts of the goat and surrounded by women and musicians, et cetera, et cetera,

639
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:22,680
against the legend. And at some point he gets out for a tour of the local village or the local city.

640
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:29,240
And normally they clean everything up. But he sees the suffering. He sees what are called the three,

641
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:35,160
I think three heavenly messengers. He sees an old person, a sick person and a dead person.

642
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,760
And he realizes that this whole thing, he realizes something that we all should know,

643
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,480
everything's impermanent. Suffering is a part of life. And if you try to pretend otherwise,

644
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:54,360
you're going to suffer even more. Then he runs off into the forest where he spends six years in these.

645
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,400
He's in his twenties here?

646
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:02,200
Yes. And he has a kid who he's named Rahula, which is poly, I believe, for

647
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,480
fetter. So speaks to what kind of dad he was. He viewed his kid as a sort of an impediment.

648
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:13,560
Flawed human being, again, this is all legend here, but runs off into the forest, spends six

649
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,800
years studying with great meditation masters. And the fashion at the time was to do this

650
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,640
self-mortification thing where you like inflict a lot of pain. You don't eat. You stand in funny

651
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,920
positions. You hang upside down, whatever. And he was doing, he was like, became the best at this.

652
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:37,320
He ultimately realized that this is, he was still suffering. So one day he actually

653
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:44,840
ate a little bit and stopped starving himself and sat down under a bode tree, a big famous

654
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:50,760
tree in Bodhgaya, India, and said, I'm not getting up until I'm enlightened. Again, this is all

655
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,040
legend. He sat there for a long time, ultimately got enlightened and had a big battle in his head

656
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:03,640
with the God of desire. And he transcended greed, hatred, and confusion. And went off and delivered

657
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,960
after he got enlightened, went off and found some of his former monks and delivered his

658
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,800
seminal speech, which was the four noble truths, which are one that life is suffering, which is a

659
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,360
mistranslation. Suffering is a bit of a mistranslation, but the idea is that everything is

660
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,400
impermanent. If you try to cling to things that will not last, you will suffer. So life is

661
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:35,400
unsatisfactory inherently because nothing lasts. Two, the root of that suffering is desire or thirst,

662
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,960
this kind of insatiability we have. And three, there's a way out of this. And four, the eight-fold

663
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:47,000
path, which is the way out of it, which includes meditation practices, ethical practices,

664
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,080
like right livelihood, right speech, right action, and then a bunch of meditation techniques,

665
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:59,560
like mindfulness and philosophical stuff about how to view the world. That's Buddhism 101.

666
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:06,840
Yeah, I mean, does it kind of amaze you that something that came to an individual or even

667
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:12,360
individuals, plural, 2600 years ago could prove to be so relevant today?

668
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:17,320
Yeah, well, so I mean, my question is whether the story that I just told you is in any way true.

669
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,200
Is it possible that this philosophy was? It's possible this was just built upon and

670
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,280
evolving over time. First of all, it seems probable to me more like. For sure the Buddha,

671
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,360
if he was a guy, if he really was a guy, and I think he probably was, there was somebody in the

672
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,160
Buddha, he was standing on other people's shoulders, but he had some real innovations,

673
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,640
including mindfulness. I guess what's amazing to me is regardless of whether it was one guy,

674
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:45,160
many guys, how long it took, et cetera, et cetera, there's no doubt that what you just said,

675
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:52,680
the four noble truths were devised in a period of time when no one could have imagined or

676
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,960
predicted the world we live in today. And yet here we are in a world today. And it's important

677
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,200
to take a step back here and think about this through the lens of evolution, right? As a species,

678
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:07,080
we are no different today than we were 2600 years ago. I mean, 2600 years represents

679
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:15,800
less than 1% of our genetic journey, identical species. But if you think about the world 200

680
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,720
years ago, no electricity, right? No irrigation, no sewer, no nothing, nothing, nothing. And you

681
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,760
think about the world today, again, not just 200 years later, but call it 2600 years later,

682
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,800
you simply couldn't imagine, like there is no one with an imagination that could have come up with

683
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:38,600
what we're going to be living in today. And yet in some ways, what you just said is more important

684
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:44,040
today. I can't imagine it was as important 2600 years ago. But it also tells you about the perennial

685
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:50,120
nature of human suffering. Which is... It's incredible. It's unbelievable. Yes, but the Buddha

686
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:57,080
had good news. It wasn't some death-defying dogma where, you know, like we can, at least not the way

687
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,560
I understand or practice it, it wasn't telling you that you can have eternal life or if you just

688
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,360
believe everything I say unquestioningly. It was more like, look, don't take it explicitly said,

689
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,280
don't take anything I'm saying at faith value. Try it out for yourself. Here's some meditation

690
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:17,320
techniques and you might be able to reduce the amount of suffering you're experiencing, much of

691
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:24,360
it kind of voluntary, in the face of life's inevitable vexations and vicissitudes. And I have

692
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:29,160
been trying this out for 10 years and in my experience, there's a lot to it. And the science

693
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,240
that has looked at it too has also been interesting. So how did you go from the meeting with Mark,

694
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,360
or the meetings with Mark? Because I know you talk about multiple meetings and just to say, I'm going

695
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:43,320
to give this thing a try. And then ultimately, what I really want to hear about is your first

696
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,400
extended meditation retreat, which is something I'm so fascinated with. Oh, the retreat. Well,

697
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,440
but even before that, because you'd obviously been practicing meditation before you went on the

698
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:56,440
retreat. So what was the... For a skeptical guy like you, what got you over the hump of...

699
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,840
All right, Dan, you're going to put your blackberry down. You're going to sit in this position and

700
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:09,640
you're going to focus on your breath. How did you make that leap? Or was it relatively easy to make

701
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:15,000
after everything you'd been through in the journey? No, I mean, I was really intrigued by Buddhism as

702
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,360
a philosophy. I cannot overstate the power for me of that initial Eckhart Tolle lifting of the

703
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,480
curtain on my own mind. Like, wow, the voice in my head is an asshole. And I'm suffering all the

704
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:36,280
time as a consequence of this. And then the Buddha's philosophy, which I think says it way better, was

705
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,360
also interesting. I was just reading lots of books about it, talking to Mark about it. And

706
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:46,760
the meditation practice as the corrective is just unavoidable as soon as you start exploring

707
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,140
the

708
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:53,400
Holy in some ways is really credited for being the first person that showed you what we would now,

709
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,880
as people who meditate take for granted, which is there's a thinker of thoughts. Those thoughts

710
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,760
are not us. Yes. And when neither is the thinker. Yeah, exactly. That's the transition that's very

711
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,440
difficult, which maybe if we have time to, I'd love to get into that. So you're basically saying,

712
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:15,720
I was already so primed because I realized the most important of the truths, the how to

713
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:23,080
tame that. I was I was so thirsty for that that basically when someone I came to trust and respect,

714
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:29,320
like Mark Epstein, who was completely rigorous, completely righteous, not a fraudster, when he

715
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,680
basically said, look, this is this is just a practice. You're just going to do start doing this

716
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,160
thing. That was pretty that was an easy step. I wouldn't say it was easy, but it got me closer.

717
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,640
Yes, that and also seeing the science. The science was a huge deal for me. And when it just became

718
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,520
obvious, I can lower my blood pressure, I can boost my immune system. There's all these brain

719
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,760
scans that show that you can have an impact on your prefrontal cortex and your amygdala. And

720
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,960
that was all very compelling, too. You know, it's really funny, just as a sort of aside for as as

721
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,000
much as I obsess over data and everything I do, whether it's this type of exercise, this type of

722
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,840
nutrition, blah, blah, blah, blah. The science has had the least impact on my interest in meditation

723
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:12,520
relative to anything I've ever done. In fact, I would argue that if you told me meditation raised

724
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:19,480
my blood pressure 10 points, I would still do it for the benefits on the reduction of my suffering.

725
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,960
And I would just figure out more drugs to take to lower my blood pressure to compensate for it. Like,

726
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,760
I literally couldn't care less about that science, which is not to be dismissive of it. No,

727
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,200
it's just to say that I don't care about any of that. I care about one thing, because there are

728
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:39,720
an infinite number of ways to lower my blood pressure, you know, do X, Y, and Z. There's only

729
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:46,040
one way I know about to understand the nature of my mind, which is an awful, awful demon.

730
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:53,080
I strongly, strongly, strongly agree with you. I use the science primarily, if not exclusively,

731
01:08:53,800 --> 01:09:01,080
as an evangelical tool. Because I know how powerful it was for me as a skeptic. Oh, yeah.

732
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,560
Even if I don't believe this thing's going to make me happier, hey, apparently there's this other

733
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,040
stuff for me, and I'm always trying to optimize, so might as well do it for that reason.

734
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,000
My experience, the science gets people over the hump, and then they no longer care. Because once

735
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,720
you've done it for six weeks or so, and you realize you're less of a shithead, you don't care if your

736
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:27,800
prefrontal cortex might look different in MRI. That's utterly irrelevant. So for me, it's really

737
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,320
useful because my job is to get people to meditate, and science is enormously helpful there.

738
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:39,800
Anyway, it was helpful for me back in the stage in 2009, and ultimately, I was on a beach vacation

739
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,600
with my wife and some friends. We had a house at the beach, and I was reading yet another book

740
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,160
about this stuff. I think for 10 or 11 years now, I've read no books other than books on

741
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,440
meditation and Buddhism. Will you read my book when it comes out?

742
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,720
I will. I kind of count that. So maybe happiness would be a better way to say that.

743
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,400
Or self-improvement in some way.

744
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,600
Self-improvement, yeah. Although I love novels. I think I've only read one in that whole time.

745
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:11,640
Me too, by the way. I stopped reading fiction in 1999, so that's 20 years ago, but I,

746
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,880
three years ago, read The Alchemist. It's the first purview back in the day.

747
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,440
But that's kind of a, isn't that kind of a spiritual?

748
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,040
It's bigger than fiction, yeah.

749
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,640
But there's so much good fiction on television that I feel like I'm getting that...

750
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,080
You get metagrides.

751
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:32,520
Yes. So anyway, I set my blackberry down because this was 2009, and I went into the bedroom where

752
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,560
I was staying with my wife, closed the door, didn't want anybody to see me because this was

753
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,400
before meditation was cool. I did not want to admit to anybody I was doing this. I kind of

754
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:45,640
sat on the floor, sat a timer, and I tried to watch my breath coming in and going out,

755
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:49,640
going in and going out. And immediately, there was like a million thoughts,

756
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,320
where did your intervals run wild, blah, blah, blah.

757
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,400
I was going to actually bring in my copy of your book. I still have the hardcover

758
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,680
first thing that came out, and I was going to do it just to read that. That's one of the

759
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,600
funniest parts of the book. And you do it, I think, three times in the book.

760
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,560
You do the, these are my thoughts. And I remember the first time reading that how hard I laugh,

761
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:17,400
thinking, I'm not the only one. I'm not the only one whose mind is an idiot.

762
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,280
Just an abject idiot.

763
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,280
Well, I think the fact that both of us share an affection for Fletch speaks to the kind of

764
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,480
humor that we...

765
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,480
It's like a torrent of thoughts.

766
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:34,120
Yes. And they're like, how ridiculous they are. How ridiculous they are.

767
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:39,080
It's amazing. I get some like my best jokes in meditation. And then, you know,

768
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:44,440
I share them with my wife, who just says, you are an idiot. And my son, who also thinks I'm

769
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,600
more on it. You can, if you have a sense of humor about it, which I think is really important,

770
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:56,760
the kind of grandiosity and randomness and negativity and ceaseless self-referentiality

771
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,000
of it can be kind of funny. So that first experience was humbling, but I actually got

772
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,960
up after the five minutes thinking, wow, I suck at this. But...

773
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,680
But you saw a light.

774
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,320
Oh, absolutely. I knew this was serious.

775
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:14,200
So this is big. This is a, at this point, almost a three-year journey. Didn't this...

776
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,760
I know the panic attack was in 04, but was it 06 that you really, in earnest,

777
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,840
started this quest to find something out?

778
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:27,560
No, I actually think... So 04 was the panic attack, and I think it wasn't until 08 that

779
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,960
I encountered Tully. And then it was a year later that I got some meditation.

780
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,720
So only for the sake of time, though, I wish we could tell every detail of the story. How long

781
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:43,800
until you took what I consider one of the most remarkable leaps to do a silent retreat?

782
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,720
A year. But I want to be clear. I often, I rarely talk about the meditation retreat because

783
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,520
I worry, as somebody whose job it is to appeal to skeptics, that the skeptic hears, oh, well,

784
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,440
this guy went on a meditation retreat. I'm never going to do that. Therefore, I'm never going to

785
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:06,600
meditate. So in my world, here's what I would say. I routinely fast for seven days at a time,

786
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:13,720
but I don't expect any of my patients to do it. And I don't think you have to do this. I think

787
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,560
one can do a whole bunch of other things that approximate 80% of that value. So through the

788
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,920
lens of, we're not telling anybody that they have to go on a seven-day or 10-day or 14-day silent

789
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,320
retreat, though I'm infinitely curious and would like to talk about it. You should do it. Yeah.

790
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:34,520
There are moments that I go back to remembering reading your book the first time. And one of the

791
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:40,440
most powerful parts of what you wrote about is something that occurred during that retreat. So

792
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,400
that's sort of why I want to kind of dig into that. There was something you wrote about that

793
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,960
blew my mind. And at the time I read it, I couldn't understand what you were talking about.

794
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,600
And even though today I still have never experienced it, I now can comprehend it.

795
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,480
Which part?

796
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,560
It was like day five or six when you actually heard the wings of the hummingbird flap.

797
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:06,040
Again, when you said that, I was like, he must be making that up or he was imagining that.

798
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,440
But I've had moments like when I do walking meditations, which are great in your app,

799
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,720
by the way, I'm just going to plug 10% happier all day long.

800
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,920
My investors think.

801
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,960
But I think Jeff Warren does a great guided walking meditation. And I think I even talked

802
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,160
about this with Sam Harris on that podcast. It was the first time I noticed that when you

803
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,800
walk, you can actually feel the wind on your finger as your hand swings forward.

804
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,120
I remember thinking to myself, how have I been walking all this time and never feeling that?

805
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,400
And then the sounds you could start to pick up. Sometimes I would just do outdoor,

806
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:47,080
like I would do a morning meditation outside, not walking, but still. And I couldn't believe

807
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,320
the sounds you could pick up. So at least now I'm at the point where I can actually imagine what

808
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,440
you're saying. But then, of course, to think, well, what would six days of silence produce?

809
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,280
So one, how did you decide to take that leap of faith? And did you view that as more part of

810
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,040
your personal development or part of your professional? I'm going to take this story

811
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,680
to its most extreme conclusion. Both, but a big dose of the latter.

812
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,880
I think that should be comforting to the listener who's thinking,

813
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,280
maybe I'll do this. Maybe I'll do a couple minutes.

814
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,920
You are to meditation what I kind of feel like I am to fasting, which is it's my job to sort of

815
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:27,320
see what the boundaries are so that, A, nobody has to go past them. And B, I have a better view of

816
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:33,640
what the landscape is. That's a pretty good comp. So there were two people who were really influential

817
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,840
in terms of getting me to do this. One was both of whom have come up, Mark Epstein and Joseph.

818
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,520
And no, I actually didn't know Joseph yet. Oh, that's right. Because Joseph was the teacher.

819
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:49,320
Was the teacher and then Sam Harris. Yes. So Sam, I met Sam Harris, prominent atheist writer. And

820
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,960
this is before he had a podcast and before he had a meditation app. And he was best known at this

821
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,200
point, just as a guy who wrote a couple of best selling books. Yeah. And you narrated, or you

822
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,880
narrated, you moderated. I moderated a debate between him and a couple of people. But one of

823
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,040
the people on the other side was Deepak Chopra and Sam kind of warm up. That doesn't even seem

824
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,040
like a fight, by the way. He was like, I don't know Deepak, but I know Sam so well. And just

825
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:18,120
knowing the caricature of Deepak, like that strikes me as a little baby seal laying there

826
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:23,240
and the guy with a club. It was a tough night for Deepak. And I say that with affection,

827
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:27,240
because he's a really wenchy, if you meet him, he's a really hard guy not to like. He's a very

828
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:32,360
likable guy. But Sam is amazing too. And I spent some, I had met Sam once before, but Sam and his

829
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:37,080
wife, Annika, who I've also friends with now, were backstage at this event and I was chatting with

830
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:42,920
them and they're so, so impressive, both of them. And I mentioned that I was meditating. And to my

831
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:48,360
great surprise, they were both avid, active meditators. And Sam had this whole long history

832
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:53,880
of having spent a bunch of time in his twenties meditating. And in that time, he became friend

833
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,080
with this eminent meditation teacher by the name of Joseph Goldstein, who happens also to be the

834
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:04,680
teacher of Mark Epstein. So I knew who Joseph was, but I hadn't met him. But I knew that Mark

835
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,560
considered Joseph to be his teacher. And Sam was saying, hey, you should go on a meditation

836
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,640
retreat. And Mark had been telling me the same thing. And I was like, well, this guy says I

837
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,960
should do it. And Mark saying I should do it. And they're both talking about Joseph Goldstein,

838
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:24,040
I should do it. And so Sam, as he said, toyed with the laws of karma and got me into a Joseph

839
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,400
Goldstein retreat, which was a very hard thing to do. And I will off I went without a lot of prep,

840
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,480
and with quite a bit of trepidation, because I thought it was gonna be a bunch of weird people

841
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,560
doing a shitload of meditation, which I really didn't want to do. I mean, I think I was up to like

842
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:44,520
10, 20 minutes a day, or at this point, I wasn't doing that much. The idea of doing it like 530 in

843
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,920
the morning until, and at night just struck me as super daunting. Was this in Marin? Where did you

844
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:56,200
go? Is it Marin County, of course, and vegetarian food and blah, blah, blah. I was a dedicated

845
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:01,720
cheeseburger eater. And being away from my wife, I didn't have a kid at the time, but there's

846
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:06,680
nothing. It just seemed like the shittiest summer vacation I could imagine. And it was,

847
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:11,080
it was all those things. I get there and it's like, I thought my, I think I wrote in the book,

848
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,240
that I thought my roommate was going to be wavy gravy, but it turned out I didn't have a roommate,

849
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:22,680
but it was a bunch of faded hippies and weirdos. And at least this is what my judging mind was

850
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:27,000
saying. They're actually lovely people that met a lot of, I've become friends with some of them.

851
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,120
But my mind was on overdrive. I was like, these are all NPR, you know, socks and sandals folks. And,

852
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,960
and the meditation itself was just awful, just awful, like sitting there all fucking day. You

853
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,040
know, I was in pain. I mean, I don't sit, I don't twist myself into a pretzel. I sit in a chair,

854
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,200
but that hurts. And the walking meditation, I'd never done that before. I didn't know what I was

855
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,840
doing. I just hated it. And I was just, it was all over the place. I didn't feel like I was getting

856
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,840
anywhere. And by day four or five, I was going to go. I was ready to quit. It was a 10 day. It was

857
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:04,680
10 days. And I went to a teacher, actually a teacher I didn't like, but she was the only one

858
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:10,360
who was available. Because you have this sort of 10 minute window each day when you can potentially

859
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,840
speak with the teacher one on one. Yeah, but you would like, they give you a time. So I was going

860
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,480
to see Joseph every other day, sometimes in a group setting with like three or four people,

861
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,960
and then sometimes one on one. But I didn't have a time with Joseph this day. And this is the day

862
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,720
I was going to quit. And one of his assistant teachers who I had made all these judgments about,

863
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:34,680
spring wash them. She was the only one I could sign up to see. So I do begrudgingly went and

864
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:40,120
saw spring who I thought was like the embodiment of all like, everything I hated about meditation.

865
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:44,920
She talked in a really soft voice, had long flowing hair and wore shawls. And

866
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:55,480
spring saved my sorry ass. What did she say? She said, you're trying to hurt. Like no, no,

867
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:01,480
like ooh, we gooey, lovey, w stuff. She just listened to me whine for a little while. She's like,

868
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,440
anyway, you're trying to hurt. Don't try to hurt. Just do you know, notice your breath when it's

869
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,120
coming in and when it's going out, when you get distracted, start again. Don't, you know, you're

870
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,560
gonna get distracted. Don't try to make anything special happen. Just stop trying to hurt.

871
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:20,040
And I was like, all right, fine. By the way, spring has gone on to become some of a very

872
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:27,400
important figure of my life. She is a extraordinary human being. But I took her word for it. And

873
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:32,040
instead of sitting in the meditation hall, I actually took my chair out of my room and pulled

874
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,880
it onto the balcony outside of on the second floor of this building where the dorm where I was staying.

875
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:43,400
And I sat outside and I was like, I'm not trying to hurt. I just sat down.

876
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:52,040
Whatever happens, happen. And it was just like, as soon as I stopped trying, the whole thing unfurled

877
01:20:52,040 --> 01:21:01,320
for me. And I was just so vividly present and mindful where I was just so quickly registering

878
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:07,000
how speedy my senses are, how I was going from hearing the rustle, the rustling of the leaves

879
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,760
to the clanking of the pots in the kitchen, which was down the hill to the footsteps in the hallway

880
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:17,960
to the feeling of my pain in my knee to an itch on my back, just to a thought coming up.

881
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:24,120
This is how reality works. It's this, you start to see how fast things are going

882
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:32,920
in your sensory life. And that's really thrilling. It's also accompanied by a huge blast of serotonin.

883
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:39,480
And this breakthrough, for lack of less grandiose word lasted for like 36 hours,

884
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:44,760
where I just was happiest I'd ever been. I wept at one point, which is quite a rare thing for me.

885
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:50,520
I'm not super emotional. It gave me an enormous amount of faith that there is so much to this

886
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:56,520
practice. And there's such a power to actually doing it in a container where that's all you have

887
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,560
to do. Your meals are cooked for you. You don't have your phone. The schedule is set for you. All

888
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:10,200
you have to do is get up and do the practice every day. But the big asterisk is, if you try

889
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:16,040
too hard, you will tangle yourself up in knots. One of the classic hindrances to meditation is

890
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,400
desire. If you want it too hard, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot. It's like a weird

891
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:28,040
video game where the only way to move forward is to not want to move forward. And that's a hard

892
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:33,560
thing to do. And the only way to get there for me is to surrender. And you can't fake surrender.

893
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,320
I go into every retreat now thinking I'm surrendered. I don't care. I don't care what

894
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,960
happens. I'm just going to sit here. But I do care. And my mind knows I care because it's

895
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:47,960
been there. The desire is in there. Yes, of course. I want breakthrough to electric boogaloo. You know,

896
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:55,240
I want like pajama jammy jam. I want the sequel to that breakthrough. And I can't get it. So what

897
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:00,760
happens is, sorry, you got a good pajama jammy jam, I'm laughing, I landed with you. This is like,

898
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,240
we're the right age where I can make a certain joke and you know the reference. What happens,

899
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:11,560
though, is if I'm on the retreat long enough, usually it's 10, 11 days, I cycle through the

900
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:18,040
reproduction attempts and I get to a genuine surrender. And it's like, I can't fake it. I

901
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:23,160
got to go through this process of trying to do this, of trying to get somewhere and then just

902
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:28,840
punching myself out. Do you feel like listening to you describe this, it's almost like the matrix

903
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:33,720
where and again, I don't think you have to be on a retreat to experience this, but there's a

904
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:40,840
realization that Neo has when he sees the matrix for what it is, that he's separate from that. And

905
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,280
do you think that that's a reasonable analogy for this idea of realizing that your thoughts are not

906
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:56,520
you? Yeah, except for separation is a problem. So the red pill of waking up and seeing that

907
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:04,680
reality is not what you thought, that works as a comp. But in fact, in actual reality, there's

908
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:11,720
no separation. So not to get into the biggest cliche of them all, being one with the universe,

909
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,960
but how can you not be one with the universe? Think you're separate from the universe? You're

910
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:23,320
created from the same atoms from the original exploding stars? You are nature. We feel our

911
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:31,400
lived experiences that we're looking out at the world fretfully from some vantage point that's

912
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:38,280
separate from nature. But like, your animal body is obviously part of nature and the workings of

913
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:45,240
your mind is part of nature. And that's mind blowing. And mind blowing just conceptually,

914
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:52,680
you might register it as I say those words, but you can experience it viscerally on retreat. And

915
01:24:52,680 --> 01:25:03,080
that is incredible. So you get back from this retreat. And I mean, can one even draw a sort

916
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:11,000
of a linearity around this and says, look, a 10 day silent retreat is the equivalent of three years

917
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,160
of a daily 15 minute a day practice. I mean, I know the answer to that question is no, but you

918
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:20,440
see where I'm trying to go with this, right? Which is, are you leapfrogging in your practice such that

919
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,760
when you came back from that 10 day retreat, even if you went back to sitting for 10 to 15 minutes

920
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:37,560
a day, you were able to quote unquote, do something better? I don't know. I feel like you're leapfrogging

921
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:46,440
your practice, but I don't know if it shows up that prominently in your 10 minutes when you get

922
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,000
home. You know what I'm saying? You build up your capacity to concentrate. Here's the here's the

923
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,560
lowest hanging fruit is one important thing in meditation is the capacity to stay present,

924
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,120
which is your concentration. Work concentration is a little hard. The image that comes up for me

925
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:07,640
is a furrowed brow, hunched shoulders, trying to concentrate, but it's more like, can you just

926
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:13,080
be awake for an extended period of time with your capacity to stay undistracted? Of course,

927
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,240
there will be distractions, but your ability to be supple in the face of those also improves.

928
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:23,880
So you can stay on the object, usually your breath longer, and the distraction doesn't throw you as

929
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:29,320
much. So that's a skill that gets built, I think, in a way on retreat that because it's such a boot

930
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:35,640
camp, you're going to build those muscles much more actively on retreat. But then you also

931
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:41,240
occasionally will have a peak experience, not always. And wanting to have one, of course,

932
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,920
is again, a hindrance. But sometimes in my experience, you'll have a peak experience.

933
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:51,640
And that shows you something that just like when you take drugs, it's like it becomes a distant

934
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,600
memory, but it's still with you in a, and when I say drugs here, I mean more plants. I haven't done

935
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,240
much at all, but you know, a lot of folks who have my understanding of the way that works is

936
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:07,080
that you have a peak experience in it. It does stay with you in the rest of your life. So in my

937
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:11,480
experience, I'm only speaking from an N of one here, but my experience having had a few peak

938
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:16,440
experiences, it's not like every time I meditate, that's coming to the table with me now. It's more

939
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:23,720
just that, first of all, I'm imbued with a much deeper faith or trust that this is a worthy

940
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:32,360
endeavor. And two, it just, it's in my mind stream that this, that some of what I've seen and

941
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:39,880
understood, some distant echoes of that are still here. When you think about how you meditate today,

942
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,560
you think about the practice you did yesterday. Can I just say something to you? Yeah, yeah,

943
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:49,480
you said before, that often meditation is unpleasant, which is the same for me. So I was

944
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:53,560
actually happy to hear you say that because it really represents a wise perspective, which is,

945
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,360
we said it before, but it bears repeating, meditation is not about what you're feeling

946
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:03,960
right now. It's just knowing what you're feeling so that your feelings don't own you. But I will

947
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:09,640
say that 10 years in, again, just speaking personally, having done five or six retreats

948
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:14,440
and having done a reasonable amount of daily sitting, I'm now at a point where my concentration

949
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,640
is good enough. So the thing to know about concentration is that it often feels really

950
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:26,120
good. Which is why people love TM, because it is a concentration meditation you're using this mantra

951
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:31,800
that you're getting really focused on. It's less, it's more focused on concentration than it is on

952
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:39,000
mindfulness. And so being able to stay awake and concentrated on something feels really good.

953
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,040
And I find that my daily meditation actually is much more pleasant because there's like a body

954
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:49,560
high associated with it. It's called, there's a word for it in the ancient language of poly,

955
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:56,520
the word is P T P I T I. And it, I think the grandiose translation is something like rapture,

956
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:01,000
but it really just means like all the kind of like body tingling and high that you can get

957
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,680
from meditation. And so that's just something to look forward to. There's a schedule for when this

958
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:12,040
shows up. And even for me, I don't always get it and wanting it guarantees that I won't get it,

959
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:17,720
but it does show up on occasion, not infrequently and can make my daily sitting.

960
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:22,680
So nice to have, you can't get too focused on it. So maybe you're sort of answering the question

961
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:28,200
that I was about to ask, which is when you think about meditating 10 years ago versus today,

962
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:33,160
it's safe to say you still think about gerbils and wonder if your hair is okay and think about your

963
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:40,200
abs is the biggest difference that you are much more quick to realize that and come back to

964
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:48,600
whatever your object is. Yes. And, and my reaction to it is much warmer. And this I think is when

965
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:53,400
you start at the bigger difference, the speed with which you recognize it or the lack of pissed off

966
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:59,880
fitness that comes with it. I think the latter is in my experience more important. Both are important.

967
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:06,120
So there's a mental acuity piece to that, which is that you're, you're, you're, you're catching this

968
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:10,760
distraction more quickly, but if you're catching it and then self-flagellating,

969
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,960
it's the purpose. Yeah, it really does because you're, you're teaching the mind that catching

970
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:20,200
yourself getting distracted is going to come with punishment. So you're in some ways,

971
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:25,240
like not incentivizing the mind to wake up. But if you can train yourself to be like, all right,

972
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:32,040
I caught that welcome to the party distraction. That's a much balmier inner weather. And I think

973
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:37,880
that feeds on itself in a really positive way. I'm not particularly good at this. I catch myself

974
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,760
lapsing into judgment all the time, but I catch the judging faster. And I'm over time through

975
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:50,040
various meditation techniques gotten better at just having a warmer reaction to my own peccadillos.

976
01:30:51,560 --> 01:31:00,760
What's the most difficult thing you've gone through personally and or professionally in the last

977
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:10,280
five years where, and where I'm going to go with this is I'm curious to how you have been able to

978
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:17,080
take this remarkable training that you've done in the last decade and begin to apply it to

979
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:22,120
difficult experiences, which is, you know, where the proverbial rubber hits the road.

980
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,560
Well, three things are coming to mind. I'll say them and you can just pick whichever ones you

981
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:33,880
want to dig in on. One was that my wife and I had a really serious fertility crisis. It ended well

982
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,160
with a baby. But that was really hard. And we were really under the impression we were not going to

983
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:44,120
have a child, which was very depressing. She also got breast cancer. Both of these were much harder

984
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,920
for her, of course, than they were for me. But obviously, you don't want to see the person you

985
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:54,280
love suffering and I or start to worry that they're not going to be around anymore. So that was

986
01:31:54,280 --> 01:32:01,640
obviously awful. And then on a much more personal, selfish level, I got a 360 review, which I think

987
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:07,080
I might have told you about once before we were recording. For anybody who doesn't know what a 360

988
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:12,920
review is, it's often used in a corporate context. It's a way to measure performance of executives.

989
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:19,240
The way they do it is they talk to the executives peers, subordinates and superiors. So you get a

990
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:29,240
holistic, panoramic 360 view into this person's performance. I began writing a book about compassion

991
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,440
and the idea, as my wife suggested, she said, well, you know, a good way to jumpstart the narrative

992
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:39,720
would be to see what other people think you should do to work on in terms of kindness and compassion.

993
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:44,200
And then my editor, there were a bunch of people in the room when she said this, and one of the

994
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:49,160
people in the room was the editor of the book. And she, the editor said, oh, you ever heard a

995
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:54,600
360 review? And I had, and I was like, oh, that's a good idea. And so we found this Buddhist

996
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,080
executive coach, Jerry Colonna, who we're talking about before, he's got this coaching firm and

997
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:05,720
they do 360s, but they do the colonoscopy version of 360s. So often 360s are these like kind of

998
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,320
data entry thing where you give people a questionnaire and they answer multiple

999
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,720
choice questions and then you crunch the numbers and you see the data. Jerry's firm does

1000
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:20,120
hour long interviews with everybody, anonymous interviews with everybody in your orbit.

1001
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:26,360
And then they write up a lengthy qualitative report with direct quotes, anonymous blind quotes.

1002
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,760
And in my case, we made it even harder because we threw in people from my personal life.

1003
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,200
And so they didn't want to just, we didn't want it to just be a professional measurement. We wanted

1004
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:39,480
to get a holistic sense of how am I? So my wife, my brother, my meditation teacher, Joseph Goldstein,

1005
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:46,200
and all these peers in total, 16 people. That was a 41 page report. We also added on a bunch

1006
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:52,840
of questions about where and when and how I'm an asshole. And it was devastating. I thought,

1007
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:58,600
oh, this is this cute little narrative conceit for this book I'm working on. And I got the 360

1008
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:06,280
and it suggested I was, well, the way I took it, it didn't say this, but I took it as monstrously

1009
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:11,560
broken, defective, incurably selfish, self-centered narcissist.

1010
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:17,640
I just want to pause you for one second because I did the exact same thing in 2015.

1011
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:23,720
It's uncanny how similar the experience is because it was everybody who worked for me,

1012
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,400
my board, like at the time I was running a nonprofit. So it was my board, everyone who

1013
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:39,080
worked for me, 10 friends plus family. I mean, this was a tour de force. And as you were telling

1014
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:44,920
the story, the only word I had in my mind was the word that described me, which was never once

1015
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,920
written, but it was the only thing that came out and it was monster. The first thing you said was

1016
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:58,200
monstrous. I believe that's what the first thing you said. I rarely slip into overt depression.

1017
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:03,800
I usually slip into covert depression, which is a shortcut to rage. This was one of the few

1018
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:10,200
times in my life I went into a overt depression after I reviewed that thing. I did not want to

1019
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:17,480
leave a dark room for days. I was eviscerated by that report. Yeah. That's the way I felt.

1020
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,760
It was awful. So how did you pick yourself up?

1021
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:26,520
Well, for a while I thought.

1022
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,720
But did you think I'm a fraud? How could I write this book?

1023
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:36,760
Yes. That's literally the word. I've just been, because I am writing the book, I just

1024
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:41,640
am working on the chapter where I read it. And fraud is a word I use because I was like,

1025
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,600
clearly I'm pretending to the world that I'm Mr. Happiness and I'm a fucking asshole.

1026
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:52,920
How did I pick myself up? Well, first I thought, okay, well, I can't do this book because

1027
01:35:53,480 --> 01:36:00,680
nobody can see this. One thing that helped was my wife and I, first of all, Jerry Colonna does a

1028
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:06,840
lot of coaching. So I read it and then I saw him that day. And he said a bunch of things that were

1029
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:12,680
super helpful. And we have an ongoing relationship. So I used to talk to him at least once a month,

1030
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:19,240
often more. One of the things he said was, and this is very Buddhist. So you now see all this

1031
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:27,080
stuff and know what we're going to do is we're going to love it. We're not going to get into shame

1032
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:34,360
or anger or self-flagellation. We're going to be like, all right, this behavior was serving some

1033
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:39,560
sort of need that some sort of primordial need you had that was not particularly skillful.

1034
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:45,880
We're going to give it a hug and say, you're no longer needed. His pushing me away from shame

1035
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:51,000
and more toward interest. Like, wow, what's going on here? Why would I do that? Why would I be

1036
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:58,360
so snippy with my subordinates? Why would I be so snippy with my wife? Why would I be so

1037
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:04,120
self-centered that I ignore other people's needs? Well, clearly, instead of just going right,

1038
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:08,920
instead of calling me a monster, Jerry was like, no, clearly, you're following some old

1039
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:16,760
script here that must have served you at some point. And putting in that light was incredibly

1040
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:21,480
useful. And then I'll say one other thing, which is that my wife, who I'm very close to my wife,

1041
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:28,280
a lot of us are close with our spouses or our life partners, but she's like a consigliere for

1042
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:35,400
me professionally. So nothing leaves my desk in terms of what I write without her thoroughly

1043
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,960
reviewing it. She's basically the uncredited co-author on both of the books I've written

1044
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:45,880
and is deeply involved in all the aesthetic choices having to do with my app. And she's

1045
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:50,680
just my right hand. That's actually not even a good way to put it because she has her own career. So

1046
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:55,960
she's really just doing this out of the goodness of her heart. But I often say to people, and this

1047
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:01,320
is not, this is like only kind of a joke. I don't know what I think until she tells me what I think.

1048
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,320
So one of the things we started-

1049
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,280
Does she have any extra time?

1050
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,800
She does now because-

1051
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,680
I could use some help.

1052
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:13,080
Sure. I don't know how she would be great at this because she's amazing. But one of the things

1053
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:17,880
that she got me to do was she and I would rent conference rooms around New York City, get out of

1054
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:24,120
our house, go to a conference room and sit there and read the report together and discuss it

1055
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:28,520
section by section. And one of the things she got me to do was focus on the first,

1056
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,160
it was a 41 page report, but the first 15 pages were positive style. And she got me to really

1057
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:37,320
focus on that. And then we went through the negative stuff. She was just like, it's not as

1058
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,640
my first reading. Nobody was calling me a monster. They were just really describing

1059
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,120
in unvarnished terms, me at my worst.

1060
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:49,080
So are you like me in that, I think my report is about the same, right? It was the first,

1061
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:57,000
maybe it was a 50-50 mix of some really beautiful, glowing, positive things. And then people who

1062
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:04,520
I know were all like all care about me deeply, including people who describe horrible things

1063
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:10,920
I've done. They love me despite those things. But do you just disproportionately naturally

1064
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:11,880
focus on the negatives?

1065
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:17,400
Well, I think we all do. Evolutionarily, we come by this honestly, we had to have a

1066
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,720
negativity bias, right? For survival. You want to have...

1067
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,640
You think you go above and beyond the evolutionary playbook? Like, I mean,

1068
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:31,320
because I think I do. I think I am... If the evolutionary playbook is to wait at 70-30,

1069
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,320
I don't know why. I think I've just adapted to 99-1.

1070
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,000
Right. Well.

1071
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,760
Which sounds like you do as well.

1072
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,120
I don't have data to support my assertion, but yes, I strongly believe I dwell in the negative.

1073
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,600
It's actually one of the things that I was dinged for in the 360. And so it was incredibly useful

1074
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:54,200
that my wife take me by the scruff and say, you know, you're going to look at this positive stuff

1075
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,640
and then we're going to look at the negative stuff and see if it's not as bad as you thought

1076
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:03,560
it was. Nobody's actually calling you a monster. And yeah, you did do some things that are really

1077
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:09,640
uncool, but you can fix this. And I'll tell you that one of the... There are a couple of comments

1078
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:15,240
made to me by people in my life that really helped me get over it. One was Joseph... The aforementioned

1079
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:22,520
Joseph Goldstein read it and said with a laugh, self-knowledge is always bad news.

1080
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,400
Wow. Interesting. So counterintuitive, right?

1081
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:36,280
Yep. And then my brother, Matt, another consigliere, prominent venture capitalist in New York City,

1082
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:43,320
an amazing human. He said two things that I thought were funny. He said, well, first of all,

1083
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:49,960
I'm sorry you had to read this. Second of all, now you got a good book. And for me as an

1084
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,360
inventor at Showman, which is another thing I was digging for in the 360, that was actually

1085
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:59,640
comforting to hear. It's like, all right, this is... I actually probably can talk about this

1086
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:04,520
and it'll be useful for people. And it's actually useful for me to hear you say that you and I...

1087
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,960
There's a huge overlap in the Venn diagram of our deficiencies. And okay, so I think there are a lot

1088
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,360
of people out there who are really selfish and have really made a bunch of bad moves, but there

1089
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:21,160
are reasons why we are like this and those can get untangled and we can work on it. And not only

1090
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:27,240
will it be good for everybody, for us and those in our orbit, direct orbit, but if we do this in

1091
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:32,760
public, it could help countless people. Now I'm really energized to work on the book.

1092
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:42,200
So this is an awesome example of pain that you can pause for a moment and realize you have some

1093
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:49,720
control over the outcome. The other two examples you gave kind of differ. Infertility and cancer,

1094
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,480
you have a lot less control over. I think it's safe to say. I mean, in the end biology is sort

1095
01:41:55,480 --> 01:42:02,200
of a complex organism. Using either one of those, whichever one you're more comfortable talking about,

1096
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:10,760
how did your practice either prepare you for and or allow you to suffer less through?

1097
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:17,240
When she had breast cancer, I found that in some ways, I think she would agree with me.

1098
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:23,320
He was actually really good for our relationship because I am not particularly, well, this is the

1099
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:28,680
story I told myself was that I'm not particularly caring and nurturing. And yet here we were in a

1100
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:34,840
situation where I really needed to be. I needed to step up and I found that I really liked it.

1101
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:41,320
After a double mastectomy, she was in a lot of pain and I wanted to sleep next to her. But if

1102
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:46,360
I slept in the bed, every time I moved, it was going to drive her crazy. So I felt good to sleep

1103
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,760
on the floor next to her, set the alarm for every three hours to make sure I got up and made sure

1104
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,800
she was ahead of her meds so that she didn't fall behind because she would have. And being of use

1105
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:02,600
in that way felt really good. Not like I'm such a good person. I mean, there's a little bit of that,

1106
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:09,080
but it feels good to be of service to somebody who you love. It feels good to be of service to

1107
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:14,680
anybody, frankly. Why do you think that didn't naturally come to you? Selfishness, self-protective

1108
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:20,360
selfishness, probably, self-centeredness. I had written a chapter in a book about it by this point,

1109
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:25,800
so I kind of knew it. I knew it, you know, but this was a very powerful example of it. And also,

1110
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:31,080
probably some of the dynamics of our relationship where she is very giving and loving and compassionate

1111
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:38,040
and I'm not. Again, this is the story. But of course I am. There's a great description of

1112
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:44,920
enlightenment in the Tibetan tradition, which is a clearing away and a bringing forth.

1113
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:52,600
And that, to me, seems like a great definition of enlightenment. So I can clear away some of my

1114
01:43:52,600 --> 01:44:00,360
bullshit and it blocks me from being useful to other people and having a... I'm trying to find

1115
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:05,160
a better word than connection, but here we go, connection. And a bringing forth of the parts of

1116
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,960
you that actually are good at that. And so that I felt was an enlightening experience and that I was

1117
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:16,760
forced to do all that. And I could see that in my mind, these registered, these acts of service

1118
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:22,200
registered as pleasant. And again, there's science here. There's a thing called the Helper's High.

1119
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,400
When you give to charity, the same regions your brain light up that are light up when you eat

1120
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:33,000
chocolate. So this isn't new then it's not unique, but it's just a universal human thing that I

1121
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:39,880
happen to stumble upon in this context in a powerful way. So I don't want to minimize that

1122
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,640
because that's awesome, but you could argue that all of those things could be experienced without

1123
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:51,480
being faced with a life-threatening disease. The part to me that I'm most interested in is

1124
01:44:51,480 --> 01:45:00,360
you are now faced with something that is, there's a probability that is non-zero and it's higher

1125
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:07,640
than it was a month earlier. This woman who is clearly the best thing that's ever happened to you,

1126
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:16,520
no offense, could be gone. So as I think about my own practice, when I've dealt with really awful

1127
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:23,080
things that have confronted me, it's this realization that we are suffering so much in

1128
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:30,280
our minds, probably more than in reality. And so much of that suffering is due to thought. It's due

1129
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:37,400
to projection. It's due to playing out scenarios that, I mean, if we're going to be brutally honest

1130
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:42,360
with yourself, we have no clue what's going to happen. And yet so much of our suffering is drawn

1131
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:50,040
out by those projections. How much of that was going on for you and how were you able to sort

1132
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:57,480
of tame that or maybe asked another way, if all of this had happened to you in 2008 versus

1133
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:03,320
2017, 18, how would it have been different? Two things are coming to mind and I don't know if

1134
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,080
either of them are going to answer the question or be useful in any way, but one of them is that

1135
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:12,680
I think, frankly, I didn't think much about the fact that she could die. Partly I knew,

1136
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:19,400
I had a pretty high level of confidence based on the original diagnosis that she was going to be

1137
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:24,040
fine. Well, maybe the fertility one's a better example then, like where there must have been

1138
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:29,240
a moment when you thought, wow, we might not be able to have kids. Oh, yeah. So in that moment

1139
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,960
where let's just say before any of this happened, you think there's a 95% chance we're going to

1140
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:37,640
have kids and now at some point you're thinking there's a 10% chance we're going to have kids.

1141
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:41,960
I'm making these numbers up, of course. At that moment when it's a 10% chance we're going to have

1142
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:47,400
kids, it's really easy to start the projection of, oh my God, are we going to adopt? If so,

1143
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:51,800
how, where, what, but it's not going to be our, blah, blah, blah. I mean, I'm just,

1144
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:59,800
I'm the author of that playbook. I could win a Nobel prize in literature for that type of

1145
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:05,480
nonsense thinking. But the point I was really driving toward is that in neither case did I do

1146
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:11,320
a particularly good job at relaxing into the uncertainty. Maybe why that could potentially

1147
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:19,240
be useful to say or to hear is that there are limits to the practice and I am not enlightened.

1148
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:25,640
I'm a schmo who started meditating 10 years ago and I'm good sometimes at applying the

1149
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:33,960
lessons and sometimes I'm not. And I think when Bianca got sick, I didn't really forthrightly look

1150
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:40,120
at the potential that she would die. And I think that when we had the infertility, I didn't really

1151
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:46,120
allow myself to fully engage with the fact that we might not have a kid and then we had a kid.

1152
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:50,360
So sometimes I'm good at this stuff and sometimes I'm not.

1153
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:55,640
How has your practice made you a better husband? I mean, maybe that's a better question for your

1154
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:59,480
wife, but where do you think it shows up most in your relationship with her?

1155
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,400
So I think it's really the moment to moment stuff. So I, while I didn't,

1156
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:09,320
I don't think I wrestled on a grand level with the mortality or the fact that we weren't going

1157
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:14,280
to be able to have a kid, but my moment to moment basic blocking and tackling of being a human in a

1158
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:20,920
relationship is much better. In other words, the mindfulness helps me see when I'm over

1159
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:26,920
7% of the time, not always, helps me see when I'm over about to be overtaken by anger or fear,

1160
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:35,320
whatever, irritation, and I can let it pass. I can feel the raw data of the anger, which by the

1161
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:42,600
way, feels really bad, but I don't need to have the satisfying energetic release of saying something

1162
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:51,320
tart that's going to get me in trouble. And that is just creates a much more seamless relationship.

1163
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:56,040
Now, over time, actually, if you add on top of it, because you can make a case, I'm increasingly

1164
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:02,280
leaning toward this, and mindfulness is just one piece of the overall Buddhist picture. And that

1165
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:08,120
alone isn't enough, like warmth, friendliness, compassion, whatever you want to call it is also

1166
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:12,040
incredibly important. And then there are also just like skills for better communication.

1167
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,680
Adding all of those things in which I'm now really starting to do as I work on this book,

1168
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:23,800
just makes it even better. So learning to be a better listener, learning how to phrase my

1169
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:29,800
assertions in ways that are less provocative, training up through meditation, my, my baseline

1170
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:35,800
level of friendliness, and ability to lean in and give a shit is all super useful. And by the way,

1171
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:40,200
feels really good when you're doing it. Because that kind of emotional availability, or what did

1172
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:47,000
you say before one of your three mechanisms were it was rage, upset, detachment, detachment feels bad

1173
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,160
in my experience. Because you know, there's a bunch of stuff you should be doing, and you feel

1174
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:57,240
guilty about that it just doesn't feel it's not doesn't feel good in my experience. So the actual

1175
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:04,840
leaning in feels better. Again, I still do detachment, rage, and say I do all of that.

1176
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:10,920
This is not you're not listening to a perfected human being talk to you now. It's just lowering

1177
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,000
the it's like a marginal improvement. So yeah, I think she would say that our day to day is much

1178
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:24,920
smoother. I doubt she can recall the last time I raised my voice, which I did do for this. And yet

1179
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,560
I think she would still say there are times where she walks on eggshells. She can just sense you're

1180
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:35,560
really pissed about something. Yeah. But then I think all the other thing is, over time, my being

1181
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,640
easier to be around has allowed her to see that some of her walking on eggshells is her own stuff.

1182
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:44,840
And she might not have gotten there if I was Robert Johnson all the time.

1183
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,240
It's funny you bring up Robert, because I was just gonna I was literally just amazing,

1184
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:55,160
like we can reach those minds here. When you think about your son, and you think about Robert,

1185
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:58,600
Terry Reel, who we've spoken about a little bit has this great expression, which I'm going to sort

1186
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:02,680
of butcher, although the expression which I have written down, I feel like it's going to be the

1187
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:09,320
opening quote on this chapter in my book, which is every man is a bridge spanning the trauma of his

1188
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:15,400
past, the legacy of his future, something to that effect. So you're a bridge, right? And you could

1189
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:22,920
make the case that some of the traits you have developed have been in response to things that

1190
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:32,200
were learned from him or his influence on others. And you, like every man have a choice about whether

1191
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:39,000
you'll pass those on to your son. I mean, it seems to me like this practice is a big part, though not

1192
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:46,680
exclusively the only part of it, but a big part of trying to leave Robert back where he belongs and

1193
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:53,320
not let him come up to be a part of your son's life. I think more, and I'm stealing some of this

1194
01:51:53,320 --> 01:52:01,800
from Jerry Polona. I don't have a pat answer to this, but what's on my mind is I think it's okay

1195
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:11,960
for Alexander to know that I have foibles and then enter Robert Johnson and enter, you know,

1196
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:16,920
Sammy from What Makes Sammy Run and all that stuff. But I think he needs to see me being okay

1197
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:23,880
with it so that he is okay with all of it. He's going to have negative parts of his psyche. And

1198
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:29,240
I think the trick is not to stamp that stuff out, but to have a supple, warm relationship with it.

1199
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:35,080
I guess what I'm getting at is not to get all psychological analysis, but I think a part of

1200
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:42,520
what Robert Johnson did when he smacked his kids around and told you that if you touched his VCR,

1201
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:46,600
he was going to beat the shit out of you. That's actually transmitting shame to you.

1202
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:52,360
There's a feeling of shame that comes to a child that's hit. It's bullying. Yeah. That's what it

1203
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:56,920
is, bullying. And the bullying is a transmission of shame. And I think that's the part that has to

1204
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:02,360
be stopped. Yeah. It's not about perfection. It's about stopping shame. Yeah. And that's how I think

1205
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:07,160
about it in my life is there were a whole bunch of things that shamed the hell out of me. And

1206
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:13,320
I think of that as my single greatest purpose in life at this point is what do I have to do to

1207
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:19,240
make sure that none of my shame makes its way to my three kids? If I can accomplish that and nothing

1208
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:24,040
else, that's great. If I can accomplish other things in life, that's even better, but I have

1209
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:30,920
to accomplish that. I mean, I sort of feel that way. And a big part of not transmitting shame for me

1210
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:37,320
is recognizing shame when it shows up. So I would challenge that slightly, but again, not

1211
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:41,640
slightly and lightly because I'm not sure I'm right about what I'm about to say, which is that

1212
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:48,600
strikes me that so my dad and mom did not inject any shame into my life. It was mostly the outside

1213
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:54,600
world. I had a very loving parents and they weren't perfect, but very loving. I don't walk

1214
01:53:54,600 --> 01:54:00,680
around resenting them for much of anything. I think it's possible I could get to a place where

1215
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,760
really I'm not the source of any shame for him and nor is his mother and he's in a really loving

1216
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:09,480
home, but the world is really tough. For sure. And so I want it to be a two-part thing. I want it to be

1217
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:17,320
that we are bottomless wells of love and affection and wisdom for him to the extent that possible.

1218
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,600
And that we show him that like you're going to have lots of dark parts of your own personality.

1219
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:31,000
It's unavoidable and you can be okay with that. I think that's my operating thesis.

1220
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,560
I actually think that's an even more eloquent way to explain what I'm suggesting, but I think

1221
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:40,200
all I'm arguing is that the home should not be that your parents, you know, there's a term they

1222
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:44,040
use for this, right? Which is your circle of origin or something to that effect, right?

1223
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:44,440
Family of origin.

1224
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,640
Family of origin, yeah. Your family of origin really isn't the place where you want the shame

1225
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:52,600
to come from because you can't control the world. Like there will be bullies at school.

1226
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,560
There will be all this other bad stuff. So yeah, I think the way you've described it is even more

1227
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:03,320
sort of nuanced and probably more accurate. I guess what I would say is my two senses,

1228
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:09,720
I think meditation has probably prevented you from transmitting some of your own shame,

1229
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:16,040
which has been manifesting itself largely in very externally positive ways. The successes you've had

1230
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:21,560
are in some ways driven, I think, by some of those attributes. In other words, your adaptations,

1231
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,800
your maladaptation have been very socially acceptable, but at some point they leak out in

1232
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,800
the weakest common denominator, which is generally to our family. Right. At least that's been my

1233
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:36,040
experience. And my, unlike the people in my immediate professional orbit. Right, the people

1234
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:41,640
who you can't fake it around for long enough. Right. So the Hotel Regina left us with a book

1235
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:46,840
and a podcast and an app that have been useful in other people's lives. So it was like a maladaptive

1236
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:53,560
thing that had a positive impact on society, but also some of the sort of not so pretty parts of

1237
01:55:53,560 --> 01:56:00,520
my motivation stayed with me and manifested in my being stressed and snippy and rushed and impatient

1238
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:06,920
and greedy and all that other stuff. And now for future projects, I got to do a better job of coming

1239
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:12,040
not from Hotel Regina, but from some other place. And this gets to something that you wrote about

1240
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:17,480
in 10% Happier, but I'm curious as to how you've evolved. One of the big questions you're trying

1241
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:24,760
to answer in your journey, as you've described it in that book is, can a person be successful

1242
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:37,080
professionally if they give up that drive, that sort of somewhat negative insecurity that feeds us?

1243
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:44,440
And I'll let the readers go through your thinking at the time, circa 2014, five years later,

1244
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,640
where are you on that particular issue, especially as you've just described it, right, which is

1245
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:55,560
Hotel Regina gave us a whole bunch of things that are externally and ostensibly very positive,

1246
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,840
but it came at a little bit of a cost. Do you believe that one can be all positively

1247
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,520
valenced without the negative or does that negative need to exist?

1248
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:09,960
First of all, I don't think you're going to make the negative go away. In my, my experience,

1249
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:14,360
I don't have a sense that I'm going to just conquer all my demons and just be operating out of a

1250
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:21,000
position of pure love. Maybe, but I don't see that coming down the pike for me right now.

1251
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:28,600
But I still think you can turn on the volume on the less wholesome motivations and turn up the

1252
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:34,280
volume on the more wholesome motivations, such as, you know, being of service, et cetera, et cetera,

1253
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:41,960
and the less wholesome one being like looking for attention and money. And not to say that attention

1254
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:46,920
and money are all bad, but if you, if you're like really, really totally focused on that to the

1255
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:52,680
exclusion of anything else, I think it's probably maybe not the best. Is there a way in there that

1256
01:57:52,680 --> 01:58:01,800
you can shift the ratios and still be successful? I, I believe yes. It may also require a little bit

1257
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:09,720
of a shifting of how you define success. And I think in there I'm starting to form a thesis,

1258
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:17,080
but I think I'm a little more nuanced in my view. During 10% Happier and the Subsequent

1259
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:23,080
Never Ending Book Tour, I really was dogmatic about the fact that you're not going to lose your

1260
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:28,440
edge. You know, look at all these professional athletes who meditate and C-suite executives and

1261
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:33,480
all this stuff. You know, and I believe that to a point, but I think at my level of meditation,

1262
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:39,160
where I've like taken it quite seriously, after a while you start to change a little bit how you

1263
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:47,080
define success. And so for example, I recently went part-time here at ABC News and that was.

1264
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:52,760
This is a big deal. This is announced a month ago. Yeah. So I was anchoring both Nightline

1265
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:58,680
and the Weekend Edition of GMA. Now I've given up Nightline and I anchor the Weekend Edition of GMA.

1266
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:05,000
I do my podcast, which is owned by ABC News and I do special investigative reporting for the network.

1267
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,120
It's still a lot, but it's part-time and the rest of my time I'm working on the app and books.

1268
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:14,040
Did I mention how much I love the app? Oh, thank you. I don't know if I mentioned that enough.

1269
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:19,240
Yeah, maybe a couple more times. You know, that was tricky because I was thinking like in some

1270
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:28,280
ways I'm dropping this dream I've had for 25 years of reaching the absolute top of TV news.

1271
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:33,400
If you think about it, I'm kind of a B-level guy. I've been very successful, but you know,

1272
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:37,960
I'm not anchoring the evening news or I'm not the main anchor of Monday through Friday GMA.

1273
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:41,960
I don't have a prime-time cable show. Those are the folks who.

1274
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:47,800
How many A-level people exist at ABC and then NBC? Like each of the three networks have how many?

1275
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,840
There was a day when Jennings and Brokaw and Dan Rather were the three,

1276
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:59,800
like the pinnacles of television. We were talking about this earlier. You said you could walk down

1277
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,800
the street with Peter Jennings circuit 2000. Yes. And you might as well been walking down the

1278
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:10,040
street with Muhammad Ali or Michael Jordan. It was crazy. Crazy. So, rough back of the napkin.

1279
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:15,960
So, there are three main networks. Each one has a single evening news anchor and each of them has

1280
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:23,880
three morning anchors. So, that's 11 people and then three cable networks. And I would say maybe

1281
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:33,320
each of them has four stars maybe, true stars. So, that's 11 plus. So, 20, 25-ish. Yeah.

1282
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:39,320
I don't think I'm going to be one of those 25. And by the way, there's massive gradations within

1283
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:46,120
the 25. I bet I wouldn't recognize 15 of those 25. That's right. But you recognize Anderson Cooper.

1284
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:50,920
Yep. Amazing person who's really been helpful to me. You would recognize George Stephanopoulos.

1285
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:57,240
Yep. Diane Sawyer. Yep. Sean Hannity. Yep. Would you recognize Joe Scarborough? No.

1286
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,320
For the listener, it's not that I'm a moron. It's just I never watch television. I can't

1287
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:07,560
actually recall the last time I've watched a television event that was not a Formula One race

1288
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:12,600
or a football game. So, we may have reached the end of the list. Yeah. So, there might be five

1289
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:16,200
people on that list. I would recognize if I saw them. But we saw a picture of Michael Strahan

1290
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:20,920
in the hallway and you recognized him. Yes. But that may have been from football. Yes. I mean,

1291
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:25,320
I knew him from the Giants. But no, but I remember I've seen him on TV. Just because whenever you're

1292
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:30,200
in the gym, that seems to be what they're showing. Right. And a lot of people who you might have

1293
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:35,960
recognized have got me too. Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose. Of course, definitely Matt Lauer and Charlie

1294
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:42,120
Rose. But everybody would have recognized Jennings and rather in Brokaw. What I was trying to say is

1295
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:48,920
that I've had to... Look, if tomorrow... When did you decide it was okay to get off the train?

1296
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:55,880
In the last year. Wow. Yes. In the last year. It's been a huge story. So, how... Was that a funeral

1297
02:01:55,880 --> 02:02:01,480
for a piece of your ego? Did you have to bury that little piece? I don't think it's clean like that.

1298
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:08,920
I think it's like... You said to me on my podcast that you're a backslider. So, I've had moments

1299
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:14,440
of realizing powerfully, okay, I'm letting this go. But then something triggers me and I start

1300
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:17,960
getting competitive and weird again. And then I remember, oh yeah, no, no, no, I'm not playing

1301
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:22,760
this game anymore. So, that's pretty much how it goes for me. I could spend a week or two out of

1302
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,000
the building, you know, working on other stuff and just not even remember I'm a TV news journalist.

1303
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,040
Unless somebody stops me on the street. And then I get back in the building and one thing or another

1304
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:37,240
happens and I start... I'm filling in on GMA and I'm around. I'm filling in on weekday GMA and I'm

1305
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:41,320
around all these big hosts and I have great relationships with these folks. But I start

1306
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:46,920
thinking, wait, should I be trying to do this? I spent 25 years trying to do this. And so, it's

1307
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:55,400
not clean. But the overall trend is toward not... My wife described it as like an app that was running

1308
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:01,320
that was sucking up a lot of my battery life, but I wasn't using it. So, I think that's starting to

1309
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:05,720
happen in a pretty big way. That doesn't mean I don't want to be in TV news. I'm actually...

1310
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:11,320
And to be clear, the app she's describing is the talk, is the self-talk, right? Yes.

1311
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:15,160
That's such a great... I like that because right now I'm having this awful issue with my computer

1312
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:23,240
where Adobe is not working well. And if I have it open, it will take 50% of my battery in one hour.

1313
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:29,480
So, my new rule is I can't have any PDFs open when I'm on the airplane and I'm working on battery.

1314
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:34,840
But that's... Now forever I will be able to... Every time I open a PDF, I'm going to think about that

1315
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:40,680
and think, hey, what's my mental Adobe reader right now? That's right. Just to close this out,

1316
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:45,720
I still want to be in TV news. I just want to be in TV news in a way that's really enjoyable,

1317
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:50,520
which is I'm not constantly angling for the next job. I'm just loving the one I have right now

1318
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,560
and trying to ace this thing. And that's just, for me, it's much more pleasant. And it doesn't mean

1319
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:59,960
I don't continue to have big ambitions. I have a startup company. I would like us to be a billion

1320
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:04,760
dollar company. Did I mention how great the app is that that company makes, by the way? Yes.

1321
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:10,360
Yes, you have. And I need billboards in Times Square with you giving this. But one of our

1322
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:15,000
competitors is a billion dollar company. And do I think we can also be one?

1323
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,960
I literally... Absolutely.

1324
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,920
And I'm sorry to piss off all the comm users. I don't think it belongs in the same sentence as

1325
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,920
your app. It's a different product.

1326
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:24,120
It is a very different product.

1327
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:28,760
So, I'm sure the defenders of that product will say yes, but it does A, B, and C, which I guess

1328
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:34,040
I don't place a premium on. But I guess for the things that I'm looking for, I think yours and

1329
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:39,080
Sam's are kind of in their own world. And I think as the market matures, you'll see...

1330
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:43,880
Yeah, you'll create these niche lanes. Yeah. And I think comm is helping a lot of people. So,

1331
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,560
I'm a terrible businessman in that I'm... You're a promoter of another product.

1332
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:51,560
Yes, I am. Because I think if somebody comes to me and says they're using comm, I'm happy for them.

1333
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:51,720
Yeah.

1334
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,880
Or if they're using Headspace, I'm happy for them. My view is I like ours better. And I would put

1335
02:04:55,880 --> 02:05:01,960
Sam's in... I'm kind of obviously rooting for Sam. I think it's impossible to put a stake in the heart

1336
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:08,200
of all of your demons forever in my view, speaking only for myself. I don't imagine all of my inner

1337
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:14,840
hobgoblins evaporating permanently. But I do think I can turn the volume down and operate out of a

1338
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,240
cooler space. Let me just give you an example. We talked about safety before.

1339
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,520
No.

1340
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,840
Remember how I noticed that Jerry Colonna has this thing about love, safety, and belonging.

1341
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:25,480
Oh, yes.

1342
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:26,200
I really keyed in on safety.

1343
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,480
But the good three needs for the children.

1344
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:33,640
Yeah. And I realized that like... It's not that my life is devoid of risk, but I can make a pretty

1345
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:42,040
solid intellectual argument that if my startup goes pear-shaped and my current situation with

1346
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:50,280
ABC News doesn't work, worst case scenario professionally, I'll still be fine. And can I

1347
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:56,440
operate day to day from the place of feeling already safe? And how will that change how I show up?

1348
02:05:57,160 --> 02:06:01,720
It means that I don't go... I'm not so sweaty and super heated in meetings. Everything isn't so

1349
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:07,000
stakes. The stakes aren't so high. I can operate from a much more relaxed place. And I've found

1350
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:13,080
that experimenting with this, which is a bit of a leap of faith, has really changed the way I show up.

1351
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:19,960
Now, how do we extrapolate that to somebody who works at Walmart? And every day they wake up and

1352
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:28,520
think, is Amazon going to close this Walmart? So it's one thing to be Dan Harris, who I would

1353
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:36,440
agree with your assessment. If ABC fired you tomorrow and the app blew up, I agree with your

1354
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:41,320
assessment. I just think you're going to be fine. I don't see any scenario under which you're not

1355
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:48,760
fine. But I don't know if I can say that about that person. And given that that person is not rare,

1356
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:53,240
there's not 17 people in the United States that feel that way or that are in that experience.

1357
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:59,080
And by the way, I feel much more like the Walmart person than you. Like I feel way more insecure

1358
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:04,120
about my existence. So I'm asking this in many ways through a very selfish lens. How do we do

1359
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:10,040
this if we're not where you are yet? I think it's an excellent, truly excellent question.

1360
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,560
There's a massive amount of privilege associated with what I just said. I don't think there's any

1361
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:21,160
way around it. We have to view this step out of the spiritual for a second and into step out of

1362
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:32,920
psychological and into socioeconomic. He's a very easy thing for a white male wealthy, highly educated

1363
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:41,160
quasi public figure to say all the shit I just said, as opposed to a Walmart worker. Never mind

1364
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:46,600
if it's a trans person or a woman of color who happens to work at Walmart. I just don't think

1365
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:52,280
there's any way around that. I do think it applies to you. I mean, you are going to be fine,

1366
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:58,440
with the exception of the white part, although you present as white. You have all of the privilege

1367
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:05,720
that I have, unless I'm missing something. Yes, no, I'm not suggesting I don't. I think I'm just

1368
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:13,320
suggesting I don't feel it. I still feel a tremendous insecurity of everything could be

1369
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:22,280
taken away tomorrow. I think if there was a better meditation practitioner and teacher in the room

1370
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:30,200
right now, she or he would have an answer to how we can all feel safe, no matter what our circumstances

1371
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:35,080
are. I just am not that person. We're bumping up against the limits of my

1372
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,920
abilities here. And you said something earlier that I think is really important.

1373
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:48,040
As I've been struggling with this chapter in my book on emotional health, right now it has

1374
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:54,760
three pillars and I suspect it will evolve. The three pillars are mindfulness, developing the

1375
02:08:54,760 --> 02:09:03,080
capacity to be mindful, developing the capacity to reframe things, which is basically stoicism and

1376
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:09,400
then some. And also cognitive behavioral therapy. Correct. And then the third pillar is relationality.

1377
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,880
And you've basically said all three of those in your own terminology. So that makes me feel better

1378
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:19,960
that I'm not on the wrong track. It might be that mindfulness is not per se the tool for that,

1379
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:26,840
that one particular insecurity, or maybe it is to some extent. But the one thing that I do

1380
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:36,360
that does give me comfort when I feel very insecure is if I lose the capacity to do my work tomorrow,

1381
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:42,920
I don't lose my relationships. That's not really me falling back on a mindfulness tool. It's me

1382
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:47,720
falling back on. It's a reframe. It's basically a reframe that says, you know what?

1383
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:54,280
If I had to give up all of the things that I love in life and if I couldn't do what I do,

1384
02:09:54,280 --> 02:10:00,600
but I still had these people in my life, I'm not going to kid myself and say my life would be just

1385
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:06,120
as good, but it wouldn't be all bad. And that's probably the closest I can come at this point to

1386
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:13,320
thinking about, to be clear, I think I have so much evolution that still has to come because I'd love

1387
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:18,840
to get to the point where I could show up from a place of zero insecurity.

1388
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:26,360
Let me just stop you on that because I hope I didn't miscommunicate in that I gave anybody

1389
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:32,520
the impression that I show up with zero fear and insecurity. It's just that I'm experimenting with

1390
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:37,320
recognizing that I don't have any, there's no rationale for it. There is limited rationale

1391
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:43,720
and that I can go into today's meetings from a feeling of like, let's just enjoy this. I can't

1392
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:47,880
believe I get to have all these meetings today about this amazing company or this amazing story

1393
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:54,440
I'm going to work on. And can I not be so clenched up because that's not helping the process or the

1394
02:10:54,440 --> 02:11:00,200
end result. That doesn't mean risk isn't out there and it doesn't mean I'm getting to zero on my

1395
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:05,720
demons. It just means that I'm turning down the volume and that's the 10% happier spirit, which

1396
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:13,480
there is no magic. It's really about marginal improvement over time with an escape valve for

1397
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:18,600
backsliding. Because that's just, I think my understanding of how human behavior works based

1398
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:24,520
on an N of one. But I think it's a pretty universal, I think we're all kind of in the same bucket in

1399
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:29,880
some ways. I'll bring up another point that you brought up something earlier. And this is sort of

1400
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:34,840
a bit tangential, but I think it is really important, which is one of my therapists, I know

1401
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:41,160
you get a kick out of the fact that I have three of them. It's just such a type A way. Nothing in

1402
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:49,160
moderation except moderation, Dan. Okay, that's my ethos. Such a type A way to do self improvement.

1403
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:56,280
But one of them made a really great point, which was the importance of my daughter,

1404
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:01,320
who's again, I think you commented on the age gap between my kids, but different, very different

1405
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:05,080
relationship with my daughter than my son. The 11 girl. Yeah, right. There's one who's almost 11,

1406
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:12,280
and then there's the big, the five and the two. And I was talking about something that I was very

1407
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:19,560
uncomfortable about, something I was very ashamed of. And the therapist said, that's funny, I may

1408
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:23,960
have been blanking on which one, it was either Terry or Esther, but it was Esther. She said,

1409
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:28,520
it's actually very important that your daughter sees how much you're ashamed of this and how much

1410
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:34,040
you're struggling with this. And it's okay if she sees you cry about this. And she really went

1411
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:41,000
through all this stuff. And in retrospect, it seems so obvious that what she was really trying to say

1412
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,480
was, you're not helping her by letting her think you're some indestructible force who's not,

1413
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:53,160
who never struggles, who doesn't have remorse, who doesn't make mistakes, and then come to repent.

1414
02:12:53,800 --> 02:13:01,560
And as obvious as that sounds now, that has historically felt wrong. Like it's felt like

1415
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:08,520
she should see me as perfect. And I should hide my mistakes from her. I think what made me think

1416
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:12,520
of that was just something you said earlier about your son, but you just said it so much more

1417
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:17,560
eloquently, right? Which is you want him to see your struggle. You want him to know that, boy,

1418
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:24,760
daddy's knee jerk reaction is to lose his mind right now over whatever. But I've figured out

1419
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:28,920
this whole practice and I'm just less likely to lose my mind now. And whatever it is that's sort

1420
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:34,040
of pissing me off, that used to piss me off for four hours is actually going to upset me for about

1421
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:39,880
two minutes. This is actually something I'm really looking forward to in life, is just as I feel like

1422
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:47,080
I'm right in the midst of finally starting to win the battle there is actually sharing that with my

1423
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:53,480
kids. My daughter is old enough to remember some of these outbursts. She has seen some brutal

1424
02:13:53,480 --> 02:14:01,000
outbursts. She has never been the recipient of an outburst, but she has been in the car when I have,

1425
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:08,840
I mean, uttered such profanity at another driver that you just, and there's no way she's not

1426
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:12,360
traumatized by that. There's no way, even though, you know, because another thing I've learned about

1427
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:19,480
children is at that age, they can't sometimes tell that it's not about them. It seems irrational

1428
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:25,720
to us. I'm clearly yelling at a person in a car who nearly killed us. How could she take that

1429
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:32,920
personally? But, you know, on some level, she's pierced by that. So for her to understand that

1430
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:38,680
your dad's flawed and he's trying to be less flawed, I think of this as like one of the greatest

1431
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:42,840
things that we could do as parents. Yeah, because she's going to have flaws. And how is she going to

1432
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:46,840
relate to them? Yeah. And that's, that's what I was trying to say before. That's the key. See,

1433
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:49,800
that's the part that you're adding to it that I don't think I've thought through.

1434
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:57,320
I'm stealing it from Jerry Colonna. So I think it's incredibly potent. You are modeling

1435
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:07,800
successful relationships with your own complexity and own demons to your kid. That not only enriches

1436
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:13,320
your behavior and relationship with the kid because they really know you, but it also just

1437
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:18,120
gives them a tool for moving through life in a way that will reduce their own suffering.

1438
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:23,320
When was the last time you saw Peter Jennings before he died?

1439
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:35,240
He called me into his office down the hall here and told me he wanted me to go to off on a trip

1440
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:40,840
to the Middle East to spend some time in Israel and then go into Iraq. And then also told me that

1441
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:45,560
there was a perception I wasn't very good at foreign coverage. But this was before he told the

1442
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:49,800
world he was dying, right? Yes. And this is just typical of him. He was like, give me this big

1443
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:57,240
assignment and also like smacking me in the face while he did it. Just like little pointed jab at,

1444
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:01,240
yeah, you need to prove to us once again that you're good at this thing, even though I had like

1445
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:06,840
spent years getting shot at. And then when I was on that trip, he announced that he had

1446
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:14,920
lung cancer. This was 05? 05, yes. That was in like late winter, early spring of 05. And then

1447
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:21,240
I didn't see him again. He called me one time in the spring and he could barely talk. His voice,

1448
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:26,440
the cancer had shredded his vocal cords. And I can't remember what he was telling me, but he was

1449
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:33,080
kind of like correcting something I had done. That's how he operated. He was very into correcting.

1450
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:40,280
And so we talked and then that was it. And then I heard he died in August. But you didn't see him

1451
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:44,600
in that interim. You never came to visit him? No. Was he not the kind of person that would want to

1452
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:49,400
have been visited? Or did you not feel close enough to him personally? No, our relationship.

1453
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:54,360
I was certainly one of his mentees and he really took that very seriously. He really took me under

1454
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,240
his wing. I don't know if he was receiving visitors, but I don't think even if he was,

1455
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:04,760
somebody would have had to cajole or invite me. Because you just wouldn't have been comfortable

1456
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:11,240
in that setting? I wouldn't have presumed that he wanted to see me. So Peter died young. He was in

1457
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:19,160
his 60s, right? Yeah, 66 I think. So if you could go back in time to

1458
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:27,400
the late 90s, you met him in what, the late 90s? 2000. 2000. So you can go back in time to then

1459
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:33,880
when he say call it 60, but you are the guy you are today. So you're still younger than him,

1460
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:38,440
but you're close enough, right? But you know these things that you've learned

1461
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:45,160
and you were having dinner with him and you know all this stuff about him, right? Which is like,

1462
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:51,000
he's this maniacal perfectionist. He is the best of the best.

1463
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:57,480
Would you be probing these things? Would you want to know if he was happy? Do you think he was happy?

1464
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,480
I think he could be happy, but I think fundamentally he seemed to me like somebody

1465
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:10,920
wasn't super happy. And I think he was driven a lot by the dark spots, you know, the wanting to prove,

1466
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:19,560
wanting to win. And yet he also, that dysfunctional part of him created so much value in that he was

1467
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:26,680
just so such an intrepid reporter. And he also trained, you know, like we learned so much by

1468
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:31,240
being near him. So there's so many journalists who are working today because, or do a better

1469
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:38,680
job because of their relationship with Peter. I'm very reluctant to push meditation on anybody.

1470
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:47,240
So I thought that's where you were going with it. But simply to probe his happiness level and what

1471
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:51,400
might be contributing to unhappiness, yeah, I do think I would have done that. I actually think

1472
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:57,800
that could have been interesting and productive. If I had evangelized meditation to him, I think

1473
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:03,000
that probably would have backfired. I can't say one way or the other, but just as a general rule,

1474
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,440
I think, even as I think about talking with some of my patients who have that phenotype,

1475
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:15,480
usually meditation isn't the place to start. The place to start is just to try to get a sense of

1476
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:20,680
the similarities between us. I'm not talking to anybody about this stuff as an authority who's

1477
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:23,960
figured anything out. I'm talking about it as a schlep who's right there. Whereas a lot of times

1478
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:28,600
when doctors talk to patients, there's this view of, well, the doctor's over here and the doctor's

1479
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:33,560
figured it out and they've got a couple of stone pillars that are carved with instructions and

1480
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:37,320
they're going to give them to you. But this is clearly an area where that's not the case.

1481
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:41,960
And maybe even using Peter as an example, which of course is just such ridiculous speculation. So I

1482
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:48,200
just want to caveat all of that. You've pointed out that one, he was arguably the single best

1483
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:56,520
that ever did this job. Two, he spawned a generation of people like you who have been

1484
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:03,240
imparted with a standard of professionalism. Anderson Cooper, Jake Tapper, Chris Cuomo,

1485
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:11,480
John Berman, Bob Woodruff, Martha Raddatz, George Stephanopoulos, I mean, Jonathan Carl,

1486
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:17,800
like on and on, just Pierre Thomas, just incredible people who came out of his orbit.

1487
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:28,520
So it begs the question that we've sort of danced around. If Peter was a Buddha Zen dude,

1488
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:34,920
could he have had that same impact or would it have simply been a different impact for which

1489
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,440
it's impossible to speculate what the net ripple effect was?

1490
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:43,240
My intuition is that you're going to have more of an impact on people if you're not

1491
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:49,400
stressing them out so much that all they can, that you shut down their ability for

1492
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:55,800
cognitive function. Because that's what he did. He was just such a bully that when you stress

1493
02:20:55,800 --> 02:21:02,360
somebody out, they can't learn well. But if he felt safe and was willing to sort of calmly impart

1494
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:07,800
the many lessons he had learned over the course of his illustrious career, I think we would have

1495
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:11,880
learned even more. Instead, one of the things we learned was how to deal with a bully.

1496
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:18,280
Dan, there is so much more I'd love to talk with you about, but I think we should save it until

1497
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:23,880
your book is in its next phase, which is to say about to come out. Talk to us about what that

1498
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:27,880
timeline looks like. So you're in the throes of writing or are you still storyboarding?

1499
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:33,640
Writing, actually writing, mostly storyboarded. It's mostly storyboarded. It's going slowly,

1500
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:39,880
but I hope it will come out early. It may come out close to when yours comes out.

1501
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:46,280
It may come out close to when yours comes out, early 2021 or mid 2021. We'll see. I mean, the

1502
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:52,520
absolute best case scenario, which I think is highly unlikely would be New Year's 2021.

1503
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:55,240
I think more likely it would be some point in that year.

1504
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:00,120
Got it. Well, I can't believe we might have to wait that long to talk again. So maybe we won't,

1505
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:02,040
but nevertheless. No, we're going to work out together.

1506
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:04,360
Well, no, no, I mean talk on a podcast. Oh, it's happening.

1507
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:06,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll definitely talk again.

1508
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:09,960
Well, thank you so much. I mean, thank you on several levels, right?

1509
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:14,040
Thank you for 10 percent happier. Just completely on a personal level.

1510
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:21,400
I'm simply not sure if that door could have been pried open with any other tool and that door had

1511
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:27,400
to be pried open. And even though it is, it's simply the beginning of a journey, I think it is

1512
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:33,560
one of the most important journeys I've ever taken and will continue to take. And just thank you for

1513
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:40,200
creating an app that I think takes something like meditation that comes with so many hang ups and so

1514
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:48,520
much baggage and makes it so completely accessible. And again, I'm biased, but it's the type of

1515
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:53,880
meditation and the type of practice that on a personal level I have found most helpful to

1516
02:22:53,880 --> 02:23:00,280
alleviate my abject misery and suffering that seems to be my default state. So thank you for

1517
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:04,520
that. And lastly, just thank you for making so much time on a weekend. Thank you.

1518
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:06,280
My pleasure. My pleasure. Thank you.
