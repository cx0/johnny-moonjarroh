00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm your host, Peter Attia.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,840
Hey Steve, as we were just talking about a minute ago, this has been a long time coming.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
I am so excited about this discussion today.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
Good.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm looking forward to it myself.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,840
You're one of those people and they're a handful of people like you where anytime we sit down,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,520
if it's over a coffee, a meal or a short phone call, I feel like my learning increases at

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,020
a geometric rate.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,480
To now be able to do a very long discussion and then share it with so many people is going

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
to be awesome.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Frankly, any discussion about longevity, I think, needs to begin with your background.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,720
I think people need to understand the curious character that you are.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:02,480
Your journey to where you are today is not common, but yet I think it speaks to the unique

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,560
lens that you've brought to this space.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,040
Give folks a sense of what you did growing up.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,960
When you were in high school, what were you interested in?

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
It was interesting.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,480
In high school, I was a math nerd and everybody assumed that I was going to be a mathematician,

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
including myself.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,440
In fact, I was a math major when I first went to college.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,560
What I really did in my spare time in high school when I wasn't playing sports is I liked

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,320
to kick around in the woods.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,520
This was in Southern California and I would actually go out into the desert.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,320
I actually had a high school biology teacher who would take students out in the desert

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
to catch rattlesnakes.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
I'm still not sure why he was doing that.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,120
I think he was milking them and getting money for the venom or something.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,920
Anyway, I had a great time doing that.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
At that time, I think I was in 10th grade, he said, you're going to be a biologist.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,440
I thought that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,960
I know I'm going to be a mathematician.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,920
After I got to college, I suddenly discovered after the first year, I didn't really like

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,680
math all that much.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
I wasn't about to spend four years doing something I didn't like.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,360
What I really liked to do was read.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,080
I switched to an English major and I actually ended up with an English degree.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,880
My goal at that point was to write the great American novel and become the Ernest Hemingway

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,560
of the latter 20th century.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,000
You went to UCLA for undergrad?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're in SoCo.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Yes, I did.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,920
That was really my job.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,480
The one thing I did is I thought, well, to write novels, I've had a pretty traditional

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,400
upbringing, middle class upbringing, except for the fact that my family traveled all over.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,480
I went to 20 different grade schools, at least.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm not sure how many, really.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
We would live two months.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,120
My dad sold our house and bought a house trailer that we put behind the car.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,760
About six years, we would spend three months in this town, four months in that town.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
This wasn't because one of your parents was in the military?

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
No.

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,960
No, my dad was a newspaper pressman.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,320
His union had something called a traveling card, which meant that if you were a union

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,600
member, you could go to any big city newspaper and be hired for some short amount of time.

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
He must have just had a travel bug.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,320
I really regret that I never asked him, what were you thinking, Dad, when you did this?

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
That's where we went.

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,080
El Paso, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Virginia, New York, Detroit.

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,880
That was my schooling, except in doing all this traveling every year, I missed probably

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,720
two months of school.

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,920
When we were traveling, my parents just threw these books at me in the back seat of the

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,480
car and said, there, it's your study time.

64
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,880
I learned a lot on my own and that probably influenced somewhat who I am because that's

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,960
a pretty unusual upbringing, probably.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:25,240
Well, I mean, I can't imagine most kids could thrive in that setting because it's so disruptive.

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:34,160
I actually had a patient once who went to 11 different schools between first and 12th

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
grade.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,920
I averaged about a year per school, so at least they didn't have to move during the

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,960
school year.

71
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,760
I always thought that that was just the social aspect of that, not to mention just the continuity.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,080
When you move from one state to the next, they may have different standards for what

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
you're going to learn in English, math, or science.

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
What you described takes that to a whole new level.

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,080
Were you ever behind in school?

76
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,260
Did you ever show up at the school that you were in and feel like you're out to lunch

77
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,280
or was it the opposite?

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
Did you generally feel like you were more than making up for it in the backseat?

79
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,200
I felt like I was more than making up for it, but I also think the school systems in

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,920
Southern California were particularly good at that time.

81
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,040
I usually had had in school a lot of the stuff that I would come across, particularly in

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,240
the South, which is the first part of this journey where we travel through.

83
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,000
In fact, it was probably made easier for me because I was an only child and I was used

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360
to being thrown on my own resources.

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,080
One of the things that I quickly figured out, because I was always the smallest kid in class,

86
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:50,240
even when I graduated from high school, I was still 105 pounds and about 5 feet 4.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,840
I quickly learned though that I could avoid being beaten up by the bigger kids if I helped

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,200
them with their homework.

89
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,040
I quickly fell into that in every school I went to.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I was the guy that would help you figure out what was going on in math or history or

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
whatever.

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,080
You're a normal sized person.

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
It's not like you're 5 foot 7 today.

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
What do you attribute such a late growth spurt to?

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,240
Well, it's kind of interesting given the topic we're going to be talking about.

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,520
When I was a sophomore in high school, I was still way behind.

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I was a wrestler.

98
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,280
I was wrestling in the 98 pound division, which is the lowest weight class, but I only

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,480
weighed 79 pounds.

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,920
At some point, my parents took me to the doctor because they were concerned about delayed

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,720
puberty and me being so small.

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,200
I got some sort of injections then.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know if it was growth hormone, I don't know if it was testosterone, but almost immediately

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,040
after that, I started going through puberty.

105
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,520
My real growth spurt was after I got into college.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,880
It was very unusual and I still think of myself as being little.

107
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,960
Even though I know I'm normal size, I still think of myself as being small.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,640
Well, that's interesting.

109
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,160
That probably speaks to the psychology of our formative years, right?

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,760
Right, exactly.

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,280
I really would be curious to know if I got growth hormone when I got those injections

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,760
or not.

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,080
All good aspiring authors you somehow lined up in New York.

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Right.

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah, I figured that was a place to be if you were going to be a great novelist because

116
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
that's where all the publishing was.

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,840
The other thing that I figured was that if I'm going to write a great novel, I don't

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,520
have anything but a typical middle class experience because at the time, I didn't realize how

119
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,680
unusual my background was.

120
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,640
I went there, but I decided I needed to start accumulating experiences.

121
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,840
I started having adventures.

122
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,920
I would hop a train from Southern California to San Francisco and back.

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,120
I got to New York by hitchhiking to New York.

124
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Later on, I hitchhiked back to California again.

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,240
When I was in New York, I thought, well, where am I going to get experiences here?

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
I ended up driving a taxi there because I thought, wow, this looks like you could really

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,320
accumulate a lot of experiences in a hurry here, which was true.

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,560
How long did it take you to learn the city?

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,720
New York is in some ways a pretty straightforward city to learn because it's on a beautiful

130
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,720
grid, but there's some nuance to it given the one-way streets and you've got Broadway

131
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,560
is diagonal.

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,380
It's not a trivial city to learn, especially given its size.

133
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,400
How long did it take you to be a competent cabbie?

134
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,080
Well, I was pretty competent right off because of the logical structure of it, but there

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,920
are these parts of the city below 14th Street, for instance, that were amazed.

136
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,080
Usually what I would do to hide my ignorance is I would just ask the passenger, which way

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,960
would you like me to take?

138
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
Then they would direct me.

139
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,360
I never really felt like I was lost there.

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Then, of course, if you got to the outer boroughs, it was a whole different ballgame, but I didn't

141
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
go to the outer boroughs very much.

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,200
When I did, I had to have help getting back because it was challenging.

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
But it was a really unique experience.

144
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,000
I drove at night, so I would go to work about four in the afternoon and come home about

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,560
somewhere between midnight and 2 a.m., depending on what the fares were like.

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,600
The experiences I had, I had people who, one person I remember well, wanted me to stop

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,080
in every bar along the street.

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,200
We did this for a while.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,760
He said, go in the bar, and he said, wait for me, and he'd come out, and we'd go to

150
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,920
the next one.

151
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,560
I finally said, if you don't mind my asking, because I was afraid he was going to go into

152
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,880
the bar and never come back, and I would be in debt for the taxi fare.

153
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,120
He said, oh, I'm looking for my wife, and when I find her, I'm going to shoot her.

154
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,240
That's the point at which I said, okay, well, you can pay your fare now.

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,600
That's a type of thing that happened to me more than a few times.

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,280
What years were this?

157
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,160
These were in the mid-1970s.

158
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,600
In New York, a totally different city from what it is today.

159
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yes, yes.

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,840
No, in those days, you could get robbed in daylight in Central Park.

161
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,560
Now Central Park is just a wonderful place to go.

162
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,920
It was, in retrospect, really quite the interesting time.

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,640
What was the dodgiest part of the city south of 96th?

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,240
Probably the extreme west side, 9th and 10th, because there was a lot of abandoned buildings

165
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
over there.

166
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,120
The lighting wasn't good.

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,440
And then, of course, Harlem was not a great place then.

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
That's why I said south of 96th.

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,120
I took that as a given.

170
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,600
I figured it was.

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,360
The interesting thing is a lot of cab drivers would not take fares to Harlem, and I would.

172
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,240
I would take somebody any place they wanted to go.

173
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,320
But I did have some dicey experiences there, I have to say.

174
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,760
I never was robbed, but I, when the only taxi driver in this garage that I knew that was

175
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,840
never robbed during that time.

176
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,080
Do you attribute that to pure luck or something else?

177
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Yeah, I do.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,680
The one time I was certain I was going to be robbed, a police car turned a corner and

179
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,520
pulled up behind me and couldn't get by because it was a narrow street.

180
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,240
So the guys that I could just tell from the vibe, this is not going to be good, they just

181
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
paid and got out and left.

182
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,200
So that was the closest that I had.

183
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Although I did pick up two taxi drivers who had been robbed and their cab had been hijacked.

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,720
And they were on the street and they waved me down.

185
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
So yeah, it was a pretty adventurous time.

186
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,080
So where was it in here, Steve, that you also began a little side hustle training animals?

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,760
Well that was after my taxi driving years.

188
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,880
What happened is that I moved back to Portland, Oregon.

189
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,320
After all of the travel that my family did, we ended up in Portland, Oregon where we

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,900
kind of settled down.

191
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,240
So I'd spent my first year, sort of sixth through tenth grades there.

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,520
I really liked it.

193
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,240
And after I got out of college, I went to Portland for a short time before I went to

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
New York.

195
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
So I went back to Portland and there I was taking karate.

196
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,240
And my karate teacher had some African lions at his ranch out in the country.

197
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,120
I used to go out and visit him and if he was cleaning the cages, I would, you know, he'd

198
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,520
say, come on in, let's talk while I'm working.

199
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
And so I'd do that.

200
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,920
And I guess I wasn't too obviously terrified because he got an offer to use the lions in

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,920
a movie in Hollywood and he needed someone to help him drive the lions to Hollywood.

202
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,960
So he asked me if I'd do that.

203
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,000
I had a job as a newspaper reporter at the time, so I thought, well, this is going to

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,760
be a long weekend.

205
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,800
So I said, yeah, I'll help you do it.

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,800
And I went out to his house and I assumed there was going to be something like a horse

207
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,480
trailer that was modified for lions.

208
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,600
And what he said was, help me get the back seat out of the car here, Steve, and we're

209
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,300
going to put Churza, which is one of his lions, in the back.

210
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
So we did.

211
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
We took out the car seat.

212
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,700
We put the lion in the back seat and we took off for L.A.

213
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,180
And there was nothing between, no screen, no window, nothing between the front and the

214
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
back seat.

215
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
But in my naiveté.

216
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,580
This is when you're wishing for the New York taxi with the plexiglass.

217
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,900
Yeah, no kidding.

218
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,620
Well, actually, I wasn't worried at first because I thought, it's his pet.

219
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,300
He must know what he's doing later on after I knew more.

220
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,500
But you weren't worried about the fact that the pet's more familiar with him than you

221
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
and if...

222
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,380
No, I should have been.

223
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,460
I should have been.

224
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,460
But here's the weird thing is that he was driving initially and the way he controlled

225
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,540
this lion was with a cattle electric prod.

226
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,400
And so he handed me this prod and it was if you push the button, it buzzes.

227
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,500
And he said, the lion's afraid of that.

228
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,640
So if he gets restless, just stick that in his face.

229
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,940
Don't touch him with it.

230
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Just stick it in his face and buzz it.

231
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,260
And so that worked once.

232
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,220
And then the battery ran out.

233
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,140
So then I said, what am I going to do now?

234
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,980
He goes, well, just hold it in his face and go, buzz with your mouth like that.

235
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,460
And I thought again, I thought, it's his lion.

236
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,780
He must know that his lion's that stupid.

237
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,700
And it turned out his lion wasn't that stupid.

238
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
That worked once.

239
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,740
And then the lion started to get really quite active.

240
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,940
And then I realized my friend was scared.

241
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,900
And that's when I got scared because I thought he knows what.

242
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,580
So we ended up pulling off on a side road in the middle of the night now, getting his

243
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:31,180
lion out on a long leash and walking it down this rural country road for several miles

244
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,460
to try to get it tired out.

245
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,200
And I was driving the car so that he could be in the headlights and see where he was

246
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,980
leading the lion.

247
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,500
And every time we would go around a corner and the lion would lose sight of the car,

248
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,780
we'd come around the corner and the lion would attack the car.

249
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,460
We'd jump up on the hood.

250
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,300
So I was expecting a catastrophe.

251
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,140
I thought there's going to be a farm and there's going to be a dog.

252
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
And the dog's going to run out.

253
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,660
But none of that happened.

254
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,820
So we put the lion in the back of the car.

255
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
It was tired.

256
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,700
It slept all the way until we got to the Bay Area when we had switched drivers.

257
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,220
And suddenly the police lights came on behind me.

258
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,420
And so the policeman pulled us over and I jumped out quickly to try to pretend this

259
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,380
was just normal.

260
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,620
But you know how in the middle of the night they'll shine their lights into the car ahead

261
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,780
of them so they can see what's going on.

262
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,540
The lion is now getting up and it's pacing back and forth.

263
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,780
And I'm saying, oh, just bringing the lion down from Disney Studios in Washington.

264
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
Very routine.

265
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Was I speeding?

266
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,260
Sorry about that.

267
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,020
And in the meantime, my friend who owns the lion is in the front seat and he's trying

268
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,820
to keep it from coming in the front seat.

269
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,100
So you can see him trying to hit it with his elbow and then the lion goes over and steps

270
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
on the car horn.

271
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,280
And so the car horn just starts shrieking.

272
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,320
So at this point the policeman said, just get out of my jurisdiction.

273
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,580
He didn't know how to deal with it.

274
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,640
So we had a rather uneventful trip down to LA.

275
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,080
At some point did you at least get a new battery for the Taser?

276
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
We didn't.

277
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
We didn't.

278
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Once we got to LA we did.

279
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,100
But by the time it was light we were close enough that the lion was asleep still.

280
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,280
So we never did.

281
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
It was really pretty interesting.

282
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,320
My intention was as soon as we delivered the lion to fly back to Portland and continue

283
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,860
on with my life.

284
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,920
But it turned out the movie producer offered me a job on the spot.

285
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,200
And he said, we're doing this movie.

286
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
We're going to have 25 lions in it.

287
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,560
We need lots of lion trainers.

288
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,680
I said, you don't understand.

289
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I have a job as a reporter.

290
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,760
This is the first time I've ever been in close contact with a lion.

291
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,040
And frankly it scared me to death.

292
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,120
So he said, don't worry about that.

293
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,040
He says, I've got lots of professional training.

294
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,400
You're the only one dumb enough to do this job.

295
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,560
I can't find anybody in my union willing to do this.

296
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,200
But yes, carry on.

297
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Exactly.

298
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Exactly.

299
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,480
So I was still pretty dubious.

300
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
I have to sell you.

301
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,800
But here was the key.

302
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,040
He said, well, the way you're going to start is I'm raising some lions at my house.

303
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,740
And so I'd like you to live at my house for the next few months and take care of the lions.

304
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,720
And the only people that you'll have to deal with is my wife and my daughter, my wife,

305
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,040
Tippi.

306
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,400
And I had this crush on this actress named Tippi Hedren since I'd seen her in the birds

307
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,540
when I was a kid.

308
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,020
And as soon as he said Tippi, I thought, gee, that's an unusual name.

309
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,420
And it turns out he was married to Tippi Hedren.

310
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,780
So suddenly I'm thinking of going and living in a house with an actress that I had a crush

311
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,820
on since I was 11 years old.

312
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,220
So that changed my attitude entirely.

313
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,060
So I said, OK, when do I start?

314
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,220
I mean, at this point, Steve, you have more than enough substrate to write a fantastic

315
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,980
novel, right?

316
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,860
Yeah, but by that time I realized that that's not where my talent lay.

317
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,900
So I really wasn't thinking anymore of writing a novel.

318
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,860
I was trying to think I loved animals so much.

319
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,340
I thought, gosh, this is great.

320
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,380
I get to spend my entire day around these animals.

321
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,340
And actually for the first year I worked there, I never took a day off on Saturday and Sunday

322
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,340
because I just enjoyed it so much.

323
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,020
So I'd almost feel like I'd been given this gift of something that I was always meant

324
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,740
to do, but by luck I had just stumbled into it.

325
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:04,700
So what finally got you to go back to graduate school?

326
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,980
Probably a bad encounter with a lion.

327
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,540
I was fairly significantly injured by a lion.

328
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,580
And I spent a couple of weeks in the hospital and a couple of more months laid up.

329
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
What happened?

330
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,060
I jumped to me.

331
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,420
A lion attacked me under a very bizarre set of circumstances.

332
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,420
And there was no one around when this happened.

333
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,500
So I was completely helpless, pinned to the ground by this lion, expecting that it would

334
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,980
start eating me at any point.

335
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,620
And again, it's one of these lucky things.

336
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:48,940
The only thing that saved me is that it grabbed me and it sunk its teeth into my leg.

337
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,700
But it was getting possessive over my leg because they get that way over food.

338
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,700
If you've ever seen a group of lions eating, they'll just get their food in front of them

339
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,460
and grab onto it very tightly.

340
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,220
And that's what it was doing.

341
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,300
And so I was just trying to stay conscious and not pass out because I thought then he's

342
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,500
going to let go of my leg and start to eat me.

343
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,060
And the only reason I'm here today is there were some people that were driving by on the

344
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,220
road above the compound.

345
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,800
And this was kind of a well-known place that people could pull off the road and they could

346
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,700
look down and they might see lions running around or tigers.

347
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,100
Where was this, Steve?

348
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,220
This is in Acton, California, which is just north of Los Angeles, out in the desert near

349
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,560
Palmdale.

350
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,960
And so they saw me with this lion on top of me.

351
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,000
So they drove up to the front office and said, there's a guy in the back with a lion on top

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
of him.

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
We don't know if that's supposed to be that way or not.

354
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,600
And so they came and rescued me, the other trainers that were in the office.

355
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,320
So that gave me a lot of time to think about my future.

356
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,960
And I really, by that time, was kind of disinterested in the Hollywood part of it.

357
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,920
I still love the animals.

358
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,880
But I really got bored with the movie aspect of it because there's a stereotype that movie

359
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,160
people only talk about movies and making movies and movie deals and movie sequels and movie

360
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,200
reruns.

361
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,160
And I didn't find that very interesting.

362
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,240
And so I'd really gotten bored with that part of it.

363
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,640
So I thought, I've accumulated all this knowledge about animals that's applied.

364
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Maybe I should go to graduate school and study it in a formal sort of sense.

365
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,120
So I actually went to graduate school with the intention of studying lions in East Africa.

366
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,920
And I went to East Africa at that point.

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,360
There was a long-running Serengeti lion project that had just ended.

368
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,600
The people that were doing it had just quit.

369
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,220
I went to graduate school.

370
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,800
My advisor did research in East Africa on monkeys.

371
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,240
And he told me, if you get over there, you might be able to take over this project.

372
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
But I didn't.

373
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,000
By the time I got there, someone else had come and taken it over.

374
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
So it didn't work out.

375
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,640
So I ended up doing a PhD that was a very combining my math and my interest in animal

376
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
behavior.

377
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,120
And I did a PhD on sort of theoretical models of animal combat and why animals very seldom

378
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,400
fight to the death.

379
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,000
And under what circumstances they might do that.

380
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,200
So I had nothing really to do with lions.

381
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,960
So at that point, I didn't really know.

382
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,280
I thought, well, I've got a PhD.

383
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,660
I guess I should be a professor somewhere.

384
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,840
But I had no interest in aging.

385
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,320
It never even occurred to me.

386
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,360
But I did a postdoc in South America at a biological station.

387
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,400
Again, unrelated to aging, I was studying these social birds.

388
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,080
But a friend of mine there was studying another group of animals.

389
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,640
But he kept catching opossums in his traps.

390
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,160
And at one point I said, you know, you're not able to catch the foxes that you want

391
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
to.

392
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,320
You're catching the opossums.

393
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
You're studying the wrong thing.

394
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,680
You should be studying the opossums.

395
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,160
So he said, well, what of interest could we do to the opossums?

396
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,920
And we put our heads together and came up with something.

397
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,880
It still had nothing to do with aging.

398
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,240
But in the course of that project, I would capture opossums once a month.

399
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,240
And I would weigh them and measure them and look in the pouch.

400
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,920
These were all females that were radio collared.

401
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,200
And one of the things I discovered was they aged incredibly quickly.

402
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
So this is an animal.

403
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,660
The South American ones that we were studying looked very much like the North American opossums.

404
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,040
Most people would not be able to tell the difference.

405
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,000
So they're about the size of a small cat.

406
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
And I expected they would live 10 or 20 years like cats do.

407
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,260
And here at 18 months, they would get cataracts.

408
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,920
They would lose muscle.

409
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,540
They would be able to parasitize.

410
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,740
They would just look terrible.

411
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,020
Even the same animal that I caught three months earlier.

412
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,240
And I just became incredibly intrigued with why they would age so much more quickly than

413
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,840
a cat.

414
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,600
And that really started my interest in aging.

415
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,680
In fact, the project that he and I were working on eventually was published in one of the

416
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,760
most prestigious scientific journals.

417
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,520
And by the time it came out, I completely lost interest.

418
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
I was interested in aging.

419
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,760
And I've been interested in it ever since.

420
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,320
So that's kind of the long story about how I got into this.

421
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,240
So after you finished your postdoc, where did you come back to?

422
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,160
My first faculty position was at Harvard.

423
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,440
And it was great because that was the point where I was switching over from what I had

424
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,200
done before, which was behavioral evolution to aging.

425
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,780
And at Harvard, junior professors, they don't care what you do really.

426
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,320
So I had some time to really gear up and switch fields.

427
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,400
It wasn't like I had to get six grants the first year or something.

428
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
And so it was great.

429
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,040
So I basically spent some time developing my first aging study, which was a field study

430
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,920
of opossums.

431
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,800
And these were North American opossums.

432
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:35,840
But I was comparing the way they aged on an island compared to the mainland.

433
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,800
And I was interested in that because there were some theories of aging that suggested

434
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,880
animals that had evolved in environments that were low risk and this island had no predators

435
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,520
on it will evolve slow aging at the same time.

436
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,120
So I ended up doing this project where I had a population of opossums on the mainland and

437
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,400
another population on the island.

438
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,440
And I would track them from birth to death because one of the nice things about opossums

439
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,840
is that because the babies are born in a pouch, if you catch a mother that's got babies

440
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,760
in the pouch, pouchung, you can mark them at that point.

441
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,660
And then if you later catch them, you can put a radio collar on them.

442
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,400
So you know the exact birth date, basically, of every animal in a population fairly quickly,

443
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,120
which is pretty unusual for wild animals.

444
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,240
So that was really how my aging career got started at Harvard.

445
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,240
It was a great experience.

446
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,480
It was a wonderful place to be.

447
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
Unfortunately, my wife hated Boston.

448
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,600
And so she was really wanting us to go somewhere else.

449
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,960
What did you find out about the opossums and what explained the difference?

450
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,480
How much of a difference was there between the groups that grew up in a low-stress environment

451
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,560
versus the high-stress predatory environment?

452
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
There was about a 20% difference.

453
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Okay, so pretty substantial difference.

454
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,600
And the next phase to figure this out was to try to work on the mechanism.

455
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,080
What is it?

456
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
And was it cortisol-related?

457
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Right, exactly.

458
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,760
This was in, you know, this by now was in about 1990.

459
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,520
And we didn't have genomics, really, at that point.

460
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,440
If we did, the first thing I would have done is sequence the genome of the opossums

461
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
on the island of the mainland.

462
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,400
But the only thing I could think of to do next was to, two things.

463
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,240
One, I was interested, is this some genetic thing?

464
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,480
In other words, did you take the island version and just let them breed?

465
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,360
Because in one generation, you'd pretty much get your answer, right?

466
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
That's exactly right.

467
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,080
And I submitted a proposal to do that, and it didn't get funded.

468
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
There was a problem.

469
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
I could only really do it in one direction.

470
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I could take the island of opossums and release them on the mainland and see how they did.

471
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
I didn't want to do the reverse because I thought,

472
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,600
if this is really a unique genetic population, now I'm not.

473
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
Right, you don't want to contaminate it.

474
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah.

475
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,920
Yeah.

476
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,400
So I never did that.

477
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,960
It was the obvious thing to do, and I thought about it, but I never ended up doing it.

478
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
And I'm sort of disappointed.

479
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,760
What I did, though, is I got a population of opossums that I brought into the laboratory.

480
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,960
And my plan was to start off with just some regular opossums.

481
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,040
And then once I knew how to manipulate opossums in the laboratory to go get some from the island.

482
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,720
But opossums are really not easy to keep in the laboratory environment.

483
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,040
And my colony ended up getting some flesh-eating infection.

484
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,240
And so I basically had to abandon that project.

485
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,200
I thought about going back to it subsequently.

486
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,640
You know, and in fact, I went back to the island,

487
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,720
which is called Sapelo Island, which is off the coast of Georgia,

488
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,320
about 10 years later with the film crew to do a film about them.

489
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,160
And in the interim, a new species had been introduced to the island.

490
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,280
Armadillos had never been there before, and now they were there before.

491
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,680
So I suddenly got worried that my population of opossums had also been contaminated.

492
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,400
So that discouraged me from going back and working on the genomics of those opossums.

493
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,800
So at what point did you begin to come in?

494
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,360
Did you start to get interested in the difference between animals in the wild

495
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,440
and animals in the lab as far as longevity differences?

496
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
And of course, where I'm going to go with this, Steve, is two directions,

497
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,520
just to give you a heads up.

498
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,360
Obviously, I want to have a really deep discussion on the largest longevity experiment ever done in

499
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,040
animals, which is the Wisconsin NIA experiment, obviously, animals in captivity.

500
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,840
And I also want to talk about the distinction between

501
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,600
mice in the wild and mice in the lab when it comes to all of the literature on CR and DR.

502
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,800
Right.

503
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,160
So it's really, I mean, and these are discussions you and I have had,

504
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
and every time we have it, it gets richer and richer.

505
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,160
So I guess what I'm really asking at the outset is,

506
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,320
when did this subject matter become of great interest to you?

507
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay.

508
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:46,000
So my background is entirely in field biology at the point when I start doing laboratory biology.

509
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So I'm coming from it from a way different perspective than most people.

510
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,360
And when I started to learn about the, not just the mice, but the other laboratory animals,

511
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,680
and how much different they were than the same species in the wild,

512
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,680
I started to get very interested in what I call laboratory evolution.

513
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:19,280
How have these things changed in the hundred years or so since they were brought into the laboratory?

514
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,120
Because, you know, when I was in the field, I'm always thinking about,

515
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,360
well, how is evolution shaping these animals to do whatever?

516
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,600
And in the laboratory, I'm thinking, well, the way that we breed them,

517
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,120
and the way that we inadvertently select them,

518
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,920
there's very strong evolutionary pressure on laboratory animals.

519
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
It's just that most people aren't aware of that.

520
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,160
So I started thinking, well, what can we learn? Is there anything to learn?

521
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,080
And one of the things that right off the bat was this dietary restriction experiment.

522
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,840
Now, before we even get to it, Steve, maybe we should explain to people

523
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,360
what a laboratory mouse looks like.

524
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,120
When you think about the B6 mouse, which is sort of the workhorse of so much of the research that

525
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,080
goes into cancer biology, I've had guests on this show before who have made a very compelling case

526
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,000
that we simply should never use that mouse model for anything that comes down to cancer therapeutics,

527
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,800
because whatever you learn in it almost assuredly is not going to apply later on.

528
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:31,920
But notwithstanding that, help folks understand what a mouse in captivity has been through.

529
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,080
What does it mean, for example, to be homozygous at each loci?

530
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,160
What is it that we're trying to accomplish?

531
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,960
What's the price we potentially pay for that?

532
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,560
Yeah, so let me describe the history of the laboratory mouse.

533
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,760
So the laboratory mice came from what were called fancy mice.

534
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,800
And these were mice that were bred for bizarre coat colors and coat textures, kinky coats,

535
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,560
straight coats, silver coats.

536
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,840
And people used to have mouse beauty contests, just like the Westminster Dog Show.

537
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,360
There used to be mouse equivalents.

538
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,880
And for all that, there probably still are mouse equivalents.

539
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,280
So at some point, this is early in the 20th century when they just rediscovered the laws

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
of genetics from Mendel.

541
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
Some geneticists got looking at all these bizarre coat colors and said,

542
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,960
this could be a nice model to see if mammal rules of inheritance are the same as plant

543
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,880
rules of inheritance.

544
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,680
So they started working with the mice for genetics.

545
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,680
And then for reasons of trying to understand the genetics, they started inbreeding them.

546
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,800
And when I say inbreeding, I'm not talking about cousin breeding.

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,080
I'm talking about brother-sister mating.

548
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,880
And they did that for now hundreds and hundreds of generations.

549
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
So the mouse that we currently have in the lab, the typical mice,

550
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,760
come from mice that were selected for bizarre coat colors and sizes,

551
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,880
mice that were then inbred for hundreds of generations so that they're

552
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,880
absolutely genetically identical to one another.

553
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,360
And then over the generations, of course, as we're raising these mice, once they started

554
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,840
being commercially valuable, the companies that produced them would always...

555
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,840
The ones that left the most young were the ones that formed the next generation.

556
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,280
So you're always getting this selection for bigger and bigger litters and faster growth

557
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
and more rapid reproduction.

558
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,920
So by now, you have what a friend of mine calls a mouse-like object.

559
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Something that looks like a mouse, but it's not only genetically identical to all of

560
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
the other ones.

561
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,720
It's now called a strain.

562
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
So B6 is a strain.

563
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
It's now called...

564
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,400
It's not only genetically identical, but again, because of the inbreeding,

565
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,600
it's homozygous at every locus.

566
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:15,360
That is, it has exactly the same two genetic variants at every single place in the genome.

567
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,800
So that makes it very, very different from any kind of...

568
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,040
From humans, certainly, but from any animal in the wild.

569
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,120
And I got very interested in how does that affect all of the experiments,

570
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,960
not just in aging, but in cancer, in Alzheimer's disease.

571
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,600
I mean, we use that one mouse.

572
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:48,960
And I used to say to people, this is like if we only tested drugs in the same set of twins

573
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,840
time after time after time after time, rather than ever going out.

574
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,760
So I agree with the people you've had on your show that said,

575
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,560
we need to really avoid this kind of reliance on such a bizarre creature.

576
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,440
I mean, it's about as bizarre of a creature from a zoological perspective,

577
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,240
as you can imagine.

578
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,000
They're twice as big as a wild mouse, at least twice as big.

579
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,440
They reach sexual maturity about twice as fast.

580
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
They have much larger litters.

581
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,280
They have a bunch of bizarre mutations and some strains become blind in a few months of age,

582
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
some become deaf.

583
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,600
Some, if they hear a loud noise, start having convulsions.

584
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,600
And this is the fundamental basis of our biomedical research enterprise as it applies to mammals.

585
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,600
So there's 4,500 species of mammals.

586
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,280
The fact that we've had one species and a very bizarre species at that be the substitute for

587
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,480
all of the others, including ourselves, is just a very weird approach.

588
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,040
And to me, it just shows that the culture of evolutionary biology is never really soaked in

589
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,360
to the laboratory biology.

590
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,160
And I've kind of made it my goal to try to help with that over my career.

591
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,680
Now, some people, of course, have gone to great lengths to avoid this.

592
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,120
So I recently had Rich Miller on the podcast and we talked about the investigation,

593
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
the intervention testing program, the ITP.

594
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,680
What is it that they do that raises the bar on rigor?

595
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,120
Right.

596
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,560
So Rich Miller is a good friend of mine and we've done a bunch of projects together on mice,

597
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
on different kinds of mice.

598
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,360
And what the ITP does is that they create what are called genetically heterogeneous mice.

599
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,200
That is, every single mouse is genetically unique, but they're all brothers and sisters.

600
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,880
So that you can recreate that population at any time, not the specific individual,

601
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,080
but the population.

602
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,840
Now, the interesting thing about those mice is that their ancestors are all these inbred mice.

603
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,920
So they've been selected for strange genetic alleles that only work

604
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,600
seemingly when they're together with themselves.

605
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,360
So I'm a very big fan of that mouse model, I have to say,

606
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,160
because I think it's a huge step in the right direction.

607
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,520
It's the least bad option, basically.

608
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
Yeah, exactly.

609
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,240
And there's one kind of weakness that I'd like to see them work on, and maybe they will.

610
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,920
And that's this, because of the breeding scheme that they use,

611
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,000
all of the mice have the same mitochondria.

612
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,560
No matter how genetically diverse they are, they all have the same mitochondria.

613
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,400
And we now know that the mitochondrial genotype,

614
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,400
because it interacts so closely with the nuclear genotype, can have a huge impact.

615
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,440
And in fact, someone here at my university, Scott Ballinger,

616
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,760
has created these mice that have different mitochondria in the same nuclear background.

617
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,640
And they have very different characteristics.

618
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:23,040
So the other thing is that because all of the current laboratory mouse came from a relatively

619
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,280
small number of these fancy mouse ancestors, they all have pretty much the same mitochondria.

620
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,560
The only differences are differences that have evolved slowly by drift over the last hundred years.

621
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:45,360
So for instance, my friend that's got the nuclear mitochondrial exchange mice,

622
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,480
his two mitochondria, which are very different by mouse standards,

623
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:57,280
only differ at five individual nucleotides in the whole 16,500 nucleotide mitochondria.

624
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,160
How many genes is that again? Is that about 20 genes?

625
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Yeah, it's about 17 typical genes, but we're finding new genes.

626
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,240
It's interesting, we're finding new genes in the mitochondria.

627
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,280
So it's around 20 or 25 genes.

628
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:19,440
So we may be missing out on a huge amount of variability that's due to mitochondria.

629
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,840
And humans, of course, have incredibly variable mitochondrial genomes.

630
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,080
Now, is it too late, Steve, to sort of say, look, we're going to go into the wild,

631
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,920
get a whole bunch of completely wild mice that are so genetically heterogeneous,

632
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,080
and we're going to start letting them breed, and we're not going to force them to be inbred,

633
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,400
we're just going to let them breed naturally. Is that just too expensive?

634
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,840
Or like, why has no one gone about trying to address this?

635
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,240
Because it's such an obvious limitation.

636
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,120
Right. Well, I think one of the reasons is the lack of genetic control that you would have

637
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,760
in that situation. There has been some attempt to do that.

638
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,960
That is, people have been working on a diverse, a genetically diverse population of mice,

639
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,560
where they took a whole number of the laboratory mouse strains and mixed in a couple of recent

640
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,080
introductions from the wild and mixed them all together to create something.

641
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,520
The problem isn't talking to those people. The wild backgrounds don't seem to breed as well

642
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,680
in captivity. So gradually, those genes are lost. But I think there are some reasonable

643
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,040
alternatives that are out there that are being developed and have been recently developed.

644
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,280
It's just that it's going to take a big change in the culture of the way we do laboratory medicine,

645
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,320
I think, before people will accept that. It probably comes back to a point you made

646
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,200
earlier, which is for many people who work in the lab using laboratory mice, that's all they've

647
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,240
known. And it might not be as apparent to them how genetically far removed they are

648
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,080
from their predecessors, whereas because you came at this from being a field biologist,

649
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,480
and also with a much greater lens for comparative gerontology, right, you're looking at this

650
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,000
opossum and that opossum, and these are both wild, and yet they have some differences, but they're

651
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,120
totally different. It may simply be a blind spot, right?

652
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,120
Yeah, I think it is. And I think that even the best mouse is still a mouse. It's still one species,

653
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:40,880
and it's a very different species than we are. And so even the best mouse model is not going to be

654
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,120
enough. We need to know more about general mammalian biology if we're going to understand

655
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,000
our own biology better. Well, before we leave the mouse, let's talk a little bit about Clive

656
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,520
McKay and kind of the history of caloric restriction. I think most people today

657
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:09,840
are generally well aware of the reported efficacy of caloric restriction in life extension.

658
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,880
There are no shortage of people that are now looking at ways to mimic caloric restriction,

659
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,160
be it pharmacologically with molecules, or be it using dietary interventions that sort of act

660
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:32,880
like transient periods of caloric restriction, all in search of what we believe CR does. But let's

661
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,920
maybe have you explain to people what this history looks like.

662
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,680
Sure. Well, the first person to really do this in a formal way was, as you mentioned,

663
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,960
Clive McKay, who was a nutritionist at Cornell at the time. And he wasn't interested in aging

664
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,880
either. He was interested in growth and how to make animals grow faster because that has all

665
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,920
kinds of agricultural implications. And so in studying growth, he was looking at the effect of

666
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,560
restricting the diet on growth rate. And when he did that, he noticed that his animals seemed to

667
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,200
be staying healthy longer and living longer when he fed them less. And he did this in fish,

668
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,720
he did some stuff in dogs, although he didn't look all the way through their lifespan. And then he

669
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:32,880
finally did this experiment in rats. In that one, he let them live their entire lives and documented

670
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,280
very convincingly how dietary restriction made, in this case, only females, not males, live longer.

671
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,280
And the interesting thing about McKay is that about a decade ago, I was a visiting scholar

672
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,200
at Ithaca, New York for a week. And I went to the Cornell libraries and I looked through all of his

673
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:05,120
old papers. And I don't think he ever really appreciated the significance of what he'd done,

674
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,640
because he didn't really follow up on that. This was in the 1930s, if I recall. Yeah,

675
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:17,440
this was in the 1930s. And he was active until the 1960s. But he got into producing high protein

676
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:25,360
bread and making nutritional food for the military during World War II. And he really kind of dropped

677
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,880
this whole thing. So even though he made what in retrospect was really, I think, a landmark

678
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,560
discovery, I don't think he really appreciated that, because he was never focused really on longevity.

679
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:44,880
So what are the ways in which this got validated and repeated throughout time? Who was the next

680
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,960
person to pick up that baton? You know, I'm not exactly sure who the next person was. There were

681
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:59,440
a whole bunch of people starting really after World War II that started looking at it more closely

682
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,480
in rats and more closely in mice. And there were actually a whole bunch of people working on

683
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,240
invertebrates that did this experiment by accident. And I'm one of them, actually. The first paper I

684
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:21,200
published on this topic was some stuff that I did during my PhD. So my PhD was testing all these

685
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,280
mathematical models about combat. But I was testing it in a small spider. And as part of that

686
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,640
experiment, I had groups of spiders that I was feeding various amounts. And I would keep them

687
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:40,080
until they died. But I wasn't paying any attention to that. Once I discovered all of this work,

688
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,320
I went back to my data and I said, well, I wonder what happened when I fed them less.

689
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,960
And it turned out the less I fed them, the longer they lived. And so after World War II,

690
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,240
people really started getting interested in this. And there were a number of people. There were mouse

691
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:04,960
studies now, rat studies. There was really, I think the next big advance was when Roy Walford

692
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:13,040
got into it, who was very interested not just in how mice age, but how that might tell him

693
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,520
something about human aging. And Ed Masero, another researcher who followed up on rats,

694
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,760
and those two, I think, really took it to the next, jumped it to the next level, which is,

695
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,160
can we understand why this is happening? There was really very little investigation of that

696
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,600
previously. But Walford, who was an immunologist, was very convinced that was doing something to

697
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:47,120
the immune system, and that was at the base of it. And Masero didn't really have his own hypotheses,

698
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,320
but he thought that it was a great way to test hypotheses about how aging worked.

699
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,440
The other big difference between these really fascinating characters, I mean, Walford,

700
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,040
was probably one of the most interesting and colorful personalities.

701
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,000
You must have known him because he only died, what, maybe 20 years ago, 25 years ago?

702
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,160
Oh, yeah. In fact, my first paper, he published the figure out of my spider paper before it was

703
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,240
published in a real journal because he had heard about my work. And he asked that,

704
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,760
I'm writing a book. Can I put this figure in my book? So yeah, I knew Roy quite well.

705
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,520
Of course, he's famous for the biodome, right? That was the...

706
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,080
Yeah, yeah. The biosphere too.

707
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,880
A biosphere, right.

708
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,120
Yeah. And it's pretty interesting when I was writing my book on, so the biosphere too was

709
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,280
this inadvertent experiment on dietary restriction because these people were sealed in this dome,

710
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,160
and they couldn't grow as much food as they thought. And Roy was the doctor in there. And

711
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,600
so this is a great opportunity. He wanted to know how dietary restriction worked in people,

712
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,800
and here he had all of these people that couldn't make enough... Anyway...

713
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,480
How long were they in the biosphere?

714
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,880
Two years. Two years.

715
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,840
And when you look at pictures of him when he came out, I mean, he looked pretty emaciated.

716
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,360
Oh, he looked horrible. He looked absolutely horrible. In fact,

717
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:24,560
they have this famous picture of them all standing on the rafters in the biosphere when they went in

718
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,000
naked, and they had the same picture that Roy showed at a meeting when they came out.

719
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,400
And you've seen pictures of him. He looks like he just emerged from a concentration camp, right?

720
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,120
Yeah.

721
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,760
Well, I wanted to use... They all look like that. I wanted to use that picture before and after in

722
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,640
my book on aging, and so I asked Roy about that. And he said, I'd love to give you that picture, but

723
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,840
everything's tied up in litigation. It turned out that the people in that experiment have become

724
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,280
enemies, and everybody was suing everybody else over everything having to do with the biosphere.

725
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:11,600
So psychologically, that wasn't such a great success. People would disagree about whether

726
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:17,600
it was a success scientifically or not. Roy thought it... He looked at it in one way,

727
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,320
thought it proved everything that he had seen in mice was true in people. Other people were looking

728
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,120
at it and say, oh my gosh, I don't know how you felt, but you just looked terrible. And then he

729
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,600
died.

730
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,720
Yeah, he died young, right?

731
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:30,880
I mean...

732
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,240
Not... Yeah, well, he wasn't that... I think he was 79 or something.

733
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,960
Oh, okay. I thought he was younger.

734
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,800
But he was always one of these people that if you knew his age,

735
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,280
you'd say, man, that guy looks 20 years younger.

736
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,960
Than he is. But after he came out of the biosphere, he didn't look like that anymore.

737
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,800
Now, the other thing, to be fair, that happened in the biosphere is that the atmosphere got really

738
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,360
out of whack. And they ended up without realizing it, they had so little oxygen, they were living at

739
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,680
the equivalent of about 17,000 feet. And so, yeah, and they'd been doing that for they didn't know how

740
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:12,960
long. Eventually, so they had to refresh the air and the environment. And he attributed his later

741
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,520
health problems to that, not to the dietary district.

742
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,720
Which is certainly plausible. I mean, we'll never know, but you have to spend some portion of two

743
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,600
years at Everest Base Camp if you haven't grown up there. It's one thing if you're a Sherpa,

744
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,640
right? But it's another thing if you've spent your whole life at sea level.

745
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:39,280
So going back to the sort of CR insights, which was the, oh, by the way, sorry, before I do that,

746
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:47,360
what can you tell us about rats versus mice in terms of the genetic diversity and the ability

747
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,080
to glean insights that are perhaps more or less interesting?

748
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:00,720
Rats are a lot different to the extent that, as I say, almost all of the traditional laboratory

749
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,800
mice strains came from this small handful of weird ancestors. Rats have a different history.

750
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,160
They were used earlier in biomedical research, actually, but they've been domesticated multiple

751
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,080
times in multiple parts of the world. So if you look at all the genetic diversity and the

752
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:25,920
mitochondrial diversity that you have in rats, it's far greater than you have in mice. And so

753
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm actually working with some other people now trying to bring the rat back more into aging

754
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,160
research because we discovered how to manipulate the genes of mice a lot earlier than we discovered

755
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,200
anything else. And so they kind of took over. That's really why almost all the focus is now on

756
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,400
that one species. We now can do these genetic manipulations in other species just as easily.

757
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:57,840
And I'd like to see something like the rats. For instance, we're working on a rat, which the two

758
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,360
mitochondria we're interested in, instead of different only at five of these nucleotides or

759
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:09,760
DNA letters, differ at 100 of them. So that's much more similar to the kind of genetic diversity

760
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,960
that you find in people's mitochondrial genomes rather than rats. So I'm hoping in the next few

761
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:23,840
years we can really... I would like to see something like like Brit Miller's interventions

762
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:30,880
testing program in rats as well, because I think I'd have a lot more confidence that something we

763
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,680
found in mice might have relevance to people if we found the same thing in rats. It's not the

764
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:43,760
ideal comparison, but considering because rats and mice are reasonably closely related, they're

765
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:51,760
kind of like we are to a rhesus macaque about that degree of divergence. But still, they're very

766
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:59,840
different. We also can do a lot more sophisticated cognitive studies with rats than we can with mice.

767
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,960
They're trainable. And so I'm hoping that over the next few years we can make an impact and bring

768
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,920
the rats back because we might learn something differently. Right now, one of the most robust

769
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:21,200
findings in mice is that if you somehow disable growth hormone activity, the mice stay healthy and

770
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,680
live a lot longer. There's only been one experiment doing that in rats, and it came to a very

771
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,520
different conclusion. It's kind of like the two primate calorie restriction studies. But again,

772
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,840
it's one study against the gazillion studies over here, but I'd like to really look at,

773
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,800
are we getting a biased picture of something like growth hormone? Because we only really know a lot

774
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:56,800
about its mechanism in mice. What is your best explanation for why the rats, given growth hormone,

775
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:04,240
fared better? They fared worse. They didn't live any longer. I don't know.

776
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,160
No, but they fared better than the mice, didn't they?

777
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:13,040
Oh, so we're talking about two different things here. So if you compare dozens and dozens of

778
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,160
mouse studies and you look at how much life extension there was with dietary restriction,

779
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,720
you look at a whole bunch of rat studies, you're right. The effect is bigger in rats. And growth

780
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:32,080
hormone is suppressed by dietary restriction. The experiment I was talking about was one where they

781
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:39,040
had taken a natural genetic mutation that disabled growth hormone in the rats, and that didn't live

782
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:46,160
longer, like the same natural mutations occurred in mice. Now, why is the effect bigger in rats

783
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:55,840
than mice? That's a good question. I don't think we know why. And I also don't know how far to push

784
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:06,240
that comparison because there's been a lot fewer rat studies done. We've done mouse studies with a

785
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,480
much greater diversity of mice. And so if you look at the biggest effect that we've ever seen in a

786
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,840
mouse and the biggest effect we've ever seen in a rat, those are not that different. So I think

787
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:25,680
it's a little bit premature to conclude that dietary restriction works better in rats generally

788
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,840
than it does in mice. That may be true, but I just don't think we know enough yet.

789
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:39,200
So speaking, of course, about big experiments with DR and CR, we have to look no further than,

790
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,480
I mean, they have to be the largest experiments done, the Wisconsin NIA experiment, correct?

791
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,280
Yes. Certainly the most expensive aging experiments that haven't been done in people.

792
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah. So, gosh, this experiment was probably kicked off in the late 80s?

793
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

794
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,800
Tell folks about the experimental design.

795
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,080
Yeah. So it was almost serendipitous that they had started at the same... So two groups,

796
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,680
one at the National Institute of Aging, one at the University of Wisconsin, and one person,

797
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,280
Rick Windrick, actually was involved in both. He was at the NIA when that project got started,

798
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:29,280
then he moved to the University of Wisconsin. And the idea was to see whether the results that we

799
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,240
saw in these laboratory rodents could be replicated in something that was a lot closer

800
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:40,240
related to humans. And also something that hadn't gone through these bizarre laboratory inbreeding

801
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:46,000
selection and all that stuff, closer to a real animal, in other words. And of course,

802
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,440
these things live up to 40 years. Actually, many people don't know, but there was another study

803
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,560
started at the same time on squirrel monkeys because they were only supposed to live 25 years

804
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,120
and they thought they could do that quicker. But it turned out squirrel monkeys were unusual. You

805
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,960
could restrict their diet, but they didn't lose weight. So they ended up abandoning that study.

806
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,880
So anyway, because monkeys live so long and it takes so long to see results, these things

807
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,960
went on for years and years. And they would publish occasional studies about their blood glucose,

808
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,320
how it affects their blood glucose, their body fat and all these. Eventually, when enough died

809
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:35,840
over the next few years, they came to very different conclusions. Now, I've got a lot of

810
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,320
friends and been involved in both of these studies. And so at the risk of irritating my friends,

811
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:48,080
I'll have to say that I think we learned something, but we learned something very different from each

812
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,320
of the studies. So let's explain some of these differences because I do think there were some

813
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,680
interesting differences. And by the way, it's an interesting footnote to just by total coincidence

814
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:06,640
that when the first of these papers was published in 2011, I believe it was the same day. So I

815
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,960
should say not published as in the scientific publication, but on the day that the New York

816
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:18,000
Times ran the story of the results of the first of them, which I think was Wisconsin.

817
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,520
Yeah.

818
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,000
On that same day, they ran the Rapa Mison ITP result, the first Rapa ITP result.

819
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,040
In 2009.

820
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,640
Yeah, 2009, in 2011, you're right.

821
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,920
What's interesting is, of course, the monkey study was front page news, the Rapa study was

822
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,880
buried in the back, barely good.

823
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,200
Really?

824
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,080
Yeah.

825
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,560
See, I didn't remember that at all. That's interesting.

826
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,600
What was different? Let's talk about what was different between these experiments.

827
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:54,480
First of all, let's talk about wild monkeys versus laboratory monkeys. So they haven't been in the

828
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,440
laboratory long enough to really have had the kind of genetic alterations that mice have.

829
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,880
But again, this comes from my, I had a long history with studying

830
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,560
lions and tigers and other big cats and bears and elephants in captivity,

831
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,720
and then seeing them also in the wild. And one of the things that we know is that

832
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:24,640
virtually all captive animals are obese relative to their wild cousins.

833
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,240
Kind of like us captive humans.

834
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,280
Exactly.

835
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,360
Yeah, exactly.

836
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:35,280
And one of the things that I did in the late 80s, early 90s, that I did some research in Papua New

837
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,600
Guinea, where we're basically studying people who are still hunting with spears and arrows.

838
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,720
And it's very similar to wild primates versus captive primates.

839
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:55,440
All captive animals are obese to a degree. Now there are some that are just frankly obese,

840
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,400
and there are some that look okay to us because we've only seen animals like that,

841
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,440
but they still have a lot more body fat. So what the Wisconsin study did is they took animals,

842
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,920
the control animals that were eating ad libitum, so they had food available pretty much all the

843
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:21,840
time, and they restricted each individual animal by 30%. So they tracked individual animals,

844
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,840
how much does it eat over a certain amount of time, and they said okay, its diet for the rest

845
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:35,120
of its life is going to be 30% less than that. And they did that for the next 35 years.

846
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,360
And this was one to one randomization, Steve?

847
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,720
Yes.

848
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,480
So just to be clear, they follow all the animals, get a baseline intake for them,

849
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,320
then they divide them in half randomly. One group gets to continue consuming that amount,

850
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,440
or gets to continue consuming ad libitum.

851
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,520
It gets what it wants to eat, ad libitum.

852
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:02,400
Okay, so that's an important distinction. The CR group gets pegged to 70% of what they were eating

853
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,360
during the run-in.

854
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,160
Right.

855
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,640
Okay.

856
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:12,880
Right. And so, you know, 35 years later, they report that the animals that are eating less

857
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:21,520
are living longer, substantially longer, and by all kinds of disease metrics, are healthier.

858
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:29,200
So pretty much replicating the laboratory experiments. Now I have to say that up to this

859
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,520
time, I really hadn't thought too much about how you would translate the laboratory rodent

860
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,920
experiments into human experiments. But suddenly, because I was asked to write something up on

861
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,480
these two experiments, I started thinking about, yeah, what are we? I mean, you think about it,

862
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:56,560
a rat or a mouse spends its life in a cage that's no bigger than a jail cell. Usually,

863
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:08,480
has very little except other animals in the cage. So has zero opportunity for much physical activity.

864
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,320
And needless to say, because they have food available all the time, because they've been

865
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,960
selected to reproduce as much as possible, they're going to get really quite big.

866
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:26,880
And I think that that was a perfect replication, the Wisconsin study, of what goes on in most

867
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:33,040
laboratory rodent experiments, which I think is what they'd intended. I think the philosophy of

868
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,400
the National Institute of Aging study was different. I think they were trying to say,

869
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,520
what is the relevance for people? And not for people who are sedentary and obese, but for people

870
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,960
generally. So what they did differently, well, I'll get to the diets.

871
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,880
Yeah, I was going to save the diets for the end. Because that to me is, I think,

872
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,360
the most important thing.

873
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,520
Let's just talk about the way they did the experiment. What they did is they said,

874
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,200
we want our control animals to be at what we consider to be a healthy body weight.

875
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,400
So we're not going to feed them ad libitum. We're going to feed them a couple of times a day,

876
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,040
and we're only going to feed them enough to keep them at what we think is a healthy body weight.

877
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,800
And we're going to restrict our other animals, our restricted animals, 30% from that. So now we're

878
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:27,520
talking the restricted ones are going to be much leaner than the Wisconsin restricted ones. And the

879
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,320
controls are also going to be much leaner.

880
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:35,280
So it's a form of pair feeding, but it's a CR pair feed, basically.

881
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,920
Yeah, exactly. And what they really were saying is, look, if you take a healthy human,

882
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,440
and you restrict a healthy human, what kind of effect are you likely to see?

883
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,800
So almost inadvertently, because I don't really think they had this philosophical difference

884
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:56,240
worked out at the time. But that's really the way I think it ended up happening.

885
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:04,640
And in this case, the animals didn't live any longer. And it was very clear. It wasn't like,

886
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,760
well, it's a little bit longer, but not quite enough to be statistically significant. So it was

887
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,160
there's no difference whatsoever. But their controls were also living longer

888
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,120
than the Wisconsin controls, which again, not surprising, because they're kept at a healthy

889
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:25,040
body weight. And these others are, you know, gotten to be frankly obese.

890
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,200
And then we get to the difference in the diets.

891
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,640
Right.

892
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,280
Which is really stark. I mean, that's, that's not a subtle distinction.

893
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,080
No, no. So so the difference in the diets is critical. So if you look at the gross

894
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,120
macronutrients, the carbohydrates, the fats, the protein, they're not that different.

895
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:54,160
But here's the critical difference is that they use natural ingredients in the NIA study.

896
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,920
In the Wisconsin study, they wanted to use what they call purified ingredients,

897
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,840
because you're complete control of this, you know, you might get a different source of

898
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:14,000
cornmeal, and it might differ slightly in nutrients. But if you're just doing specific,

899
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,480
if you're just doing albumin, you know, you're always getting the same protein.

900
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,040
The trouble is that that wasn't a very palatable diet. And to make it more palatable, to do the

901
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:32,000
carbohydrates, they were adding sucrose. And by the end of it, well, I think by the time they

902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:40,960
figured out the diet, it was a, they were 28%, 28.5% sucrose diet in Wisconsin, and, you know,

903
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,920
very low sucrose, you know, all these natural ingredients.

904
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,600
I think it was about 3% sucrose in the Bethesda mice, right?

905
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,560
Versus, as you said, 28, 29% sucrose there.

906
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,840
Um, Bob Kaplan did an analysis for me. We write about, you know, we've written about this,

907
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:03,760
I think, in a, in a weekly newsletter or something. But the, the Wisconsin monkeys

908
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:10,000
were effectively eating the equivalent. If they were humans, they were effectively eating

909
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:18,800
three Big Macs, two large fries, and two jumbo cokes a day. That was the equivalent of their diet.

910
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,600
Um, and then you were, so you were basically getting a control animal that's eating like

911
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,280
three Big Macs, two monster fries, and two jumbo cokes a day. And then the controls were getting,

912
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:36,880
or sorry, the CR group was getting 70% of that. In Bethesda, it was basically like a whole foods

913
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:46,960
pescatarian diet, right? With 3% sugar in it. Um, and you know, it's a bit of a shame because it

914
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,080
doesn't allow us, in my opinion, to appreciate the effect of the weight difference. Because as

915
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:58,800
you said, the controls in each group, there's no comparison, right? The, the control group in

916
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Bethesda was the longest lived animal. Uh, pardon me, the CR group in Bethesda and the control

917
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:11,360
group were the longest lived animals. And they actually lived longer than the CR groups in

918
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:17,840
Wisconsin. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this isn't, this isn't a surprise when I said they started off

919
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:23,840
with these squirrel monkeys as well. One of the reasons they abandoned that was they soon realized

920
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,160
the squirrel monkeys were living longer than any squirrel monkeys that ever been reported to live

921
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:35,600
before as well. And now they're racist Macaques have been reported to live longer than any Macaques

922
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:42,240
have been before. It's interesting because as, as often happens in science of two groups do what

923
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,200
seems to be the same experiment, although with the, I agree with you, this wasn't really the same

924
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,320
experiment, but if they seem to do what's superficially the same experiment, they come to different

925
01:09:52,320 --> 01:10:00,320
conclusions. They're not happy about it. And so in one of the attempts to reconcile the data,

926
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:08,560
they looked at the weights of the control animals in Wisconsin versus Bethesda, but compared to all

927
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,760
of the racist monkeys in the country and all of the research facilities in the country and the

928
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:20,880
Wisconsin ones were about 10% heavier and the controls now and the Bethesda ones were about 10%

929
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:28,080
lighter. So, um, you know, like I say, I think they're telling us something differently. Someone

930
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,960
might want to know if instead of eating two big Macs and two helping some fries and two giant

931
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:42,320
cokes a day, what if I only ate 70% of that? Would I be healthier? Then you as a physician would

932
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,600
probably say, yeah, yeah, eating less of really toxic food is good for you. That's exactly my

933
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:55,440
conclusion from that study is in a still somewhat contrived way. I think what we learned is the worse

934
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:02,080
the diet, the more beneficial the caloric restriction, the better the diet, the less

935
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,880
of an impact caloric restriction has. And what that says to me is dietary restriction might be as

936
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,720
important if not more important than caloric restriction. By dietary restriction, I mean

937
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:19,520
manipulating or reducing, uh, components of the, uh, macro or micronutrient. And in this case,

938
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,880
the sucrose was head and shoulders. I mean, to me, this was basically an experiment demonstrating

939
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,480
the harm of sucrose. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you looked at, uh, what they call, uh,

940
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,920
glucoregulatory problems and the controls that were massive and there were zero of those in the

941
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,600
restricted animals. And I'm glad you brought that up because it reminds me the control animals in

942
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:48,800
Bethesda, I either fully fed animals in Bethesda had less diabetes than the calorie restricted

943
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,240
animals in Wisconsin. I don't know that that's correct. I don't, I don't remember Wisconsin

944
01:11:54,240 --> 01:12:00,640
reporting any. No, I think it was, I think it, I think it was, I think this was an after publication.

945
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,480
I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Okay. We'll, we'll confirm that for the show notes, but I think this is

946
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:10,720
something that came out much later, but I actually think that the, that the group eating 70% of the

947
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:16,080
high sugar diet had had a higher incidence of diabetes than the control in Bethesda,

948
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,520
which again, just speaks to dramatic differences in, um, what you're feeding.

949
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:29,040
Yeah. And, and I have to say, I don't think we've ever really gone back and worked out the best

950
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:37,600
diets for mice or rats. I think there's a lot still to be done in those, you know, we, most

951
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,360
of those standards were really just developed for keeping them healthy so they could breed.

952
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:52,240
And, uh, I think that if we really wanted to understand more about nutrition in those animals,

953
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:57,120
we'd have to go back and do that with modern techniques. If we really wanted to understand

954
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,080
nutrition of rats and mice, I don't think we understand it very well.

955
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,080
And there's no way to really study monkeys in captivity without limiting their exercise. Right.

956
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:15,840
I mean, there's, there's, is it, is it possible? Well, I think it is. I mean, it's, it's possible.

957
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,880
I think there are two problems. One is that because you need to control the diet,

958
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:29,840
the animals were kept individually housed. And this is a very social species, just like we are.

959
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:40,560
Right. And so cognitively, psychologically, these had to be extremely unusual animals on top of that,

960
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:47,360
because of the size of the cages that they had. Yeah. There was virtually no, uh, opportunity for

961
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:53,280
physical activity. That's very similar to the rat and mouth studies. Right. But I think for primates,

962
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,880
it's probably worse. I think it's, yeah, I think it's much worse cognitively. I'd have to think

963
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,800
it's terrible. Um, I mean, they were in a room where they could see each other, they could hear

964
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,920
each other, they could smell each other, but they couldn't touch each other. And I think if you,

965
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,040
So they didn't even get to mingle outside of feeding times?

966
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
No, no. Why?

967
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,800
Probably had to do with the, with the, with captive setup that they had in those two places.

968
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:30,400
Um, it's not easy to get strange monkeys to interact with one another. He might end up with a lot of

969
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,960
fighting. And at least one of the other differences between the two studies was the Wisconsin animals,

970
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,400
were all monkeys from India that were born in captivity. And so they knew the precise age.

971
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,160
In the Bethesda study, they, they sort of added animals of different ages as they got them.

972
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:55,120
Some of them came from the wild and some of them, they kind of guessed the age at the start.

973
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:02,800
And some of them came from China. So some genetic differences as well. So, um, so yeah, your, your,

974
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:09,920
your basic conclusion that nutrients seem to count, I think is, is very valid. And I think that,

975
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,880
I think it's also something, you know, I always say that humans are the worst

976
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,040
animal study that you could imagine because they don't do what you tell them to do,

977
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:27,120
you know, and they'll lie about what they do. But on the other hand, there's certain kinds of

978
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:33,760
studies that I think you have to do in humans. And I think that the idea that the nutrition

979
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:40,160
that works best for a mouse, even if we knew what it was, might not tell us anything. I mean, mouse,

980
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:47,360
mice eat seeds and insect larvae in the wild and we're very different. So I think for these

981
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,640
kinds of nutritional studies, I think you really do have to study humans because humans have their

982
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,080
own unique characteristics. Which is a point I'm going to absolutely want to bring us back to as

983
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,600
we look to one of the great challenges of studying humans is not only the timescale and the difficulty

984
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:10,720
with interventions, but frankly, the lack of biomarkers that could really help us assess

985
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:18,400
geoprotection. But I want to go back to kind of what you think would happen to animals

986
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:26,560
calorically restricted in the wild. Do you think that if we could, and imagine this as a thought

987
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,640
experiment, although I believe this experiment has also been done in some form or another, where you

988
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:38,480
calorie restrict wild mice. What do we know about that? Yeah, so I actually did an experiment like

989
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,480
this. So I didn't calorie restrict wild mice in the wild, I calorie restricted wild mice in the lab.

990
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:51,680
So I brought them into the lab because one of the ideas that I had, which turned out not to be

991
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:57,360
correct, was that we have selected, well partially correct, we have selected these animals to grow as

992
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:05,040
fast and reproduce as fast as possible. So we may have created gluttonous mice just by laboratory

993
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:10,000
selection over dozens and dozens of generations. Mice after my own heart basically.

994
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,920
So wild mice of course don't have that. So I went out and I caught a bunch of wild mice

995
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,480
and I brought them into the lab and I let them have babies for a couple of generations to get

996
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:29,920
rid of all the contaminants of being in the wild. And then I restricted their diet. And what I found

997
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:40,000
was that there was no difference whatsoever in how long they lived. Now I have to say,

998
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,160
I'm watching the animals die and they're right on top of one another almost. And I'm just ready to

999
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:54,080
say there's no way that dietary restriction works in wild mice. But then the last few, the last 20%

1000
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,520
lived longer. The restricted ones were living longer and longer and longer. So all of the

1001
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:07,200
longest lived ones were in the restricted group. So what I concluded from that is that these are

1002
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:12,720
wild animals. They're genetically diverse. So I thought, well maybe, because the other part of

1003
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:17,680
this I didn't imagine, is very early on when I restricted them, a number of the restricted ones

1004
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:26,480
died early in the experiment. So maybe depending on your genes, dietary restriction would be good

1005
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:33,680
for you, can have very little impact on your health, or can be bad for you. The ones that died early,

1006
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:40,880
Steve, what did you, when you examined them after death, what were you seeing? You know, I don't

1007
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:48,240
think that we did enough necropsies on the early ones that died to know that. It's not very easy to

1008
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:57,360
to get good necropsy material on mice because their bodies cool off so quickly and their

1009
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,680
tissues start to degenerate so quickly. So almost all of what we know about mice

1010
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,480
pathology is from mice that were euthanized. And I don't think we euthanized any because we didn't

1011
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:17,920
expect them to die when they were young like that. So maybe they had some nutritional requirement

1012
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,360
that we weren't meeting. Like I say, we were using standard laboratory chow and that's,

1013
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,200
you know, we don't really know how good that was. Which I mean, standard mouse chow is total garbage.

1014
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:37,200
That's probably a good reason to be concerned. At the upper end, Steve, did you see a, I mean,

1015
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,520
I guess if you didn't euthanize them, you wouldn't know, but you'd expect to see cancer being the

1016
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,040
biggest difference. Although do wild mice suffer cancer to a fraction of the extent that in bred

1017
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:52,080
mice do? They do to a fraction, but they don't. Yeah, we did for the ones that lived longer,

1018
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,480
most of those we were watching much more carefully because they were getting to the

1019
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,000
point where we were expecting them to die. So we have quite a bit, we probably have

1020
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:07,360
necropsies on about at least 20 mice in each group. And yeah, they still get mice. They still

1021
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,480
get a lot of cancer because let's face it, mice in the laboratory live on average about

1022
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,720
two and a half years. And the longest live ones live about three years. In the wild, they live on

1023
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:25,200
average about three or four months and the longest live ones live maybe a year or a little longer.

1024
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:31,120
So we're talking about incredibly long live mice. So yes, about half of them

1025
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:36,560
had cancer when they died. I don't know if that's what killed them, but they had cancer when they

1026
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,800
died. But if you bring lower, that's a lot lower than live mice. If you bring wild mice into the

1027
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,120
lab, how long do they live when you take away their predators and you insure them food?

1028
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,600
They live, they live a little bit longer than, uh, than your laboratory mice,

1029
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,200
maybe 20% longer. Okay. So they are a healthier mouse.

1030
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,640
They're pretty healthy. Despite, despite not being bred for being in a lab. Well, I mean,

1031
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:06,800
if I gave a handful of these mice to people that were only familiar with laboratory mice,

1032
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,680
they wouldn't have any idea. They're looking at the same species that first of all, they bite.

1033
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:18,320
Secondly, they can jump. You know, when we change mice from cage to cage, we set the cage down,

1034
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,200
we take the top off, we pick the mice up, we put them in the new cage. You take my wild mice,

1035
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:28,720
you take the top off and you got popcorn, you know, they're, they're all over the place. And

1036
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:34,960
there's a common test that we do in laboratory mice for sort of coordination and balance,

1037
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,880
which is called a rotorod, which is kind of like log rolling for mice. Right. And the idea is that

1038
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,920
this is probably 18 inches off the ground. So they're afraid to fall. So we'll sit there and

1039
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:53,920
try to stay on the circulating rod. Try that on a wild mouse and just immediately leap off the

1040
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,600
thing and leap off to your desk and leap onto the floor and they're gone. There's another one that

1041
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:06,240
we call, called the raw, the wire hang, which is just what it sounds. Take mice and you hang them

1042
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:11,600
from a wire like they're dangling a pushup. And you say, how long can they stay before they fall

1043
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:18,000
off? It's like kind of a grip strength test. Yeah. Yeah. And you do this to a wild mouse and

1044
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,240
it does a pull up, it pulls itself up onto the wire and it runs off the wire and that's the end

1045
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:29,760
of your test. So when I say there's no comparison between them, I'm really meaning that you could

1046
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,840
take the most sedentary overweight person you could imagine and say, okay, I'm going to compare you

1047
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,040
to this trained athlete, you know, and that's the kind of comparison you get.

1048
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:48,720
Cognitively, it would be really interesting to see as well. The trouble is wild mice are not

1049
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:54,400
used to being around people. So, you know, they're freaked out when you touch them. And so you can't

1050
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:03,920
do the same kinds of cognitive tests, which is unfortunate. But on the other hand, this is what

1051
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:10,400
you have with the other thing is if a domestic mouse wants to get away from you, it jumps back

1052
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,520
in his cage and sits there. You know, if wild mice wants to get away from you, bites you and then it

1053
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:21,760
jumps off the table and onto the floor and it's gone. So if you had to do the thought experiment,

1054
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:30,080
which is you're going to take a group of wild mice in their environment, remove the predators.

1055
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:38,160
So assume that they can live a little bit longer. One group gets 100% of their necessary nutrition.

1056
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:44,400
The other group gets 70% of that. Do you believe that the CR group would live longer?

1057
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:52,800
No. No, I don't. Do you think they would live shorter? Quite possible. I think probably yes.

1058
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,960
And I'll tell you why. So this experiment has not been done because it's hard to do.

1059
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:03,600
But the reverse has been done. So there have been a lot of studies where people have

1060
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:10,320
supplemented the food of animals in the wild. So they don't have to go out and forage as much,

1061
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,920
because I'm going to give them as much as they need to eat every day. So you would expect, okay,

1062
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:21,040
now I'm going to get obese mice that are going to be short-lived. But that's not what you get.

1063
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:29,360
You get mice that live longer. And they live longer because they're foraging less. They're

1064
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,920
exposing themselves to less predation. The reason I think that if you restricted animals in the wild,

1065
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:42,160
they would live shorter, is that the first thing is they would have to forage longer.

1066
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:49,520
They would have to take chances to go after food. They don't normally go after.

1067
01:24:51,040 --> 01:25:00,160
They would possibly eat things that they normally don't eat that might be toxic. So my thought

1068
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:04,560
experiment is that the animals, if you did this in the wild, if you could somehow control

1069
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,800
the available food for them, that they would be shorter-lived. The other thing is that there's

1070
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,160
a couple of things that calorie restriction does that don't seem compatible with the long life in

1071
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:25,280
the wild. One of these is that it slows wound healing. The other thing is that it makes animals

1072
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:33,680
more susceptible to certain kinds of pathogens. And those two things in the laboratory are not

1073
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:40,160
a big deal because they don't get wounded. And we spend a great deal of time and effort to keep

1074
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:47,680
pathogens out of the colonies. But in the wild, those are very important causes of pathology and

1075
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:54,720
things that you need to work well. So that would be my guess is that they would probably be

1076
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:02,960
shorter-lived. Are there any other studies in the animal literature that you think can shed light on

1077
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,880
this very important question as it pertains to an extrapolation into humans?

1078
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:17,600
Well, I mean, there's the human studies. Yeah, of course. Before we get to calorie and

1079
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,920
cronies and stuff like that. No, I don't think so. I mean, you know, when I first came into this and

1080
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,760
people told me about this phenomenon, the first question I asked, well, if this is so healthy,

1081
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:38,320
why don't animals in the wild not eat less? And of course, the answer is that the animals that

1082
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:43,360
have the genes that have survived for millions of generations out there are the animals are the best

1083
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,640
at reproducing. Right. They're not optimizing for the longest life. They're optimizing for the most

1084
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:54,720
reproduction. That's right. And so I said, well, of course. So they probably eat more than is

1085
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,320
perfectly healthy because that helps them reproduce faster. It made perfect sense. And so

1086
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:10,880
I don't find it particularly surprising that you get this kind of health because that's

1087
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,720
not what nature has designed any of us to live as long as possible. That's kind of up to us to figure

1088
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:25,360
out how to stay healthy long. Nature was fine with us when we were living 35 years. Yeah.

1089
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:35,360
So I know I can't think of any other experiments that I would there. Yeah. There's one experiment

1090
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:41,840
that was done that where they took mice that had been genetically altered so that they lived longer

1091
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:49,200
in the laboratory and they put those in a field. Exposure with some normal mice and just came back

1092
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:56,000
18 months later. And the ones that live longer in the lab were shorter life. They're almost all

1093
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,120
gone in the real world. So there's a slight complication to that experiment, which is a

1094
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,640
follow up experiment showed that, well, that same mutation, they don't necessarily live longer in

1095
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:18,560
the lab. It was one of these, you know, unfortunate false results that couldn't be replicated.

1096
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:26,080
But that's the way science works sometimes. So let's turn to the human studies then,

1097
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:32,320
which obviously don't have the luxury of the same duration relative to the lifespan of the animal.

1098
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:41,840
But what have we learned there? Right. So there's I think you have four human studies,

1099
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:51,600
five maybe. So the first one I think was the Biosphere 2 study. But we don't know much about

1100
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,320
what happened. Most of the people in that study were pretty young. Roy was a real outlier. Roy

1101
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:03,760
Walford was I think 66 at the start of that experiment, 68 when he came out. But certainly

1102
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:10,240
from their blood analysis, they had very good cardiovascular risk factors. Their blood pressure

1103
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,800
was extremely low. Their blood glucose was extremely, of course, those were all exceptionally

1104
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:22,640
healthy people when they went in. So this was not a random group. The calorie studies are the two

1105
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:30,480
best controlled studies in humans. And there was two of them. There was one that was very short

1106
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:36,080
term, six months. And then there was another was slightly longer term, which was two years.

1107
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,920
How many institutions were a part of these two studies?

1108
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,920
Three institutions.

1109
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,600
Go to Pennington, there's one, right?

1110
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:52,640
Pennington, Washington University, and then Tufts. And Tufts didn't publish anything out of the first

1111
01:29:52,640 --> 01:30:00,080
phase of the study, I don't believe. But in the second one, they did. So to me, I'll just give you

1112
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:07,120
my bottom line on those studies is that people can't do calorie restriction in that traditional

1113
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:17,200
sense. I mean, in all cases, the goal was to reduce calorie intake or energy imbalance by about 25%.

1114
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:25,920
And they never came anywhere close to actually getting that. In the longer study, I think,

1115
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:34,160
ultimately, the amount of restriction was about 11 to 12% that people were able to achieve over

1116
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:42,160
two years. Because these people were in charge of their own nutrition. It's not like the study

1117
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:47,360
could afford to actually give everybody all of their food every single day, which would at least

1118
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,080
give you some hope of doing that if participants could limit themselves to eating the provided

1119
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,320
food.

1120
01:30:53,120 --> 01:31:02,080
Yeah, as I recall, I think they provided meals initially for a short term. But they didn't

1121
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,880
monitor whether the people wouldn't eat anything else as well. And then they were on their own.

1122
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:14,400
And so it's quite clear that people can't, normal people, there are people that can,

1123
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,680
but certainly your average person cannot. So in none of those that they achieve

1124
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,240
anywhere close to the dietary restriction, they had hoped to do.

1125
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:32,560
So what did they find with what they did achieve? Cardiovascular risk factors, all improved,

1126
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:38,400
certainly. You know, blood pressure was better, lower insulin, lower glucose.

1127
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:48,000
But there were some things, lower bone mineral density as well. So it's a mixed bag. And the

1128
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:55,040
main thing is, if you look at a dietary restricted mouse, it's got almost no body fat.

1129
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:02,000
Both of these experiments, the thing we struggle with is that most people are

1130
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,160
overweight or obese in the US, where these were both done, right? So your control group

1131
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:17,440
is not going to be like the Bethesda monkeys. So what that means is if they can only achieve

1132
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,960
10% dietary restriction, you're going to get people that are on the verge of being overweight

1133
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:29,280
or obese and getting them down to a healthy body weight. And I don't think it's surprising anybody

1134
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:36,480
that that's good for your health. And that's pretty much what they found. They never got people

1135
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:44,960
to that extreme leanness that Roy Walford and the people in the biosphere had, or that the subsequent

1136
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:53,920
the cronies have. So I think you could generally say from the calorie studies that, yes, reducing

1137
01:32:54,640 --> 01:33:03,520
your food intake had lots of benefits, had some possible negative effects in terms of bone mineral

1138
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:10,320
density, had some negative effects in strength loss, although not if corrected for body weight.

1139
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:17,360
But yeah, generally beneficial. But again, take somebody that's on borderline overweight,

1140
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:23,280
reduce them to a healthy body weight. I don't think any physician, it wouldn't have to be a

1141
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:30,000
specialist like yourself, any physician, I think, would say, yeah, okay, what's the news?

1142
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:37,360
So that's what I take away from that. Now the other study is the study of the cronies.

1143
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:44,080
And these are people that belong to a society called the calorie restriction society

1144
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:52,640
that have taken the rodent work and assumed that is going to make us healthy longer. And they really

1145
01:33:52,640 --> 01:34:01,680
have restricted themselves like we really do to mice. And they also have good, very good

1146
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:09,760
cardiovascular risk factors, less inflammation, they're probably going to get less cancer,

1147
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:19,920
but they have low bone mineral density, negligible sex hormones, you know, whole suite of things,

1148
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:26,320
no muscle mass to speak of. I've spoken at a couple of their conferences, and they're always

1149
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:32,000
exhorting one another to exercise more, because they have trouble with this degree of restriction,

1150
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,080
keeping any muscle mass at all. But it's a struggle because they don't really have the

1151
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:44,640
energy. Yeah, yeah. So, so these people typically have what how much of a BMI, Steve, these are

1152
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:52,240
people that are 1718 BMI at this point. Yes, I'd say 17 to 20. Yeah, the interesting thing is in

1153
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:57,440
that society, if you look around the room, I would say probably 30% of the people are actually

1154
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:04,640
doing it like that. The others are maybe aspiring to do it, but not quite making it they look more

1155
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:11,760
like an average person would look. But yeah, that that's that's the problem. And I'm not sure,

1156
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,320
now that all these other diets are starting to come out, how many people are still sticking with

1157
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:22,160
that? Because I haven't I've kind of lost track over the last few years of what's going on with

1158
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:29,680
those people. The other thing is, they're all they they have very low thyroid hormone. So they're,

1159
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:34,320
they're cold all the time. So one of the things I noticed at a comfortable room, everybody would

1160
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:42,400
be wearing a jacket that was really BMI of 18. So and we don't actually know the impact of this on

1161
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,520
long term cognition, do we? I think the on cardiovascular and cancer, it's pretty clear

1162
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:52,960
that they will have a benefit. Not clear with respect to dementia, not clear with respect to

1163
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:59,680
immune function, and certainly not clear with respect to the diseases of frailty. In fact,

1164
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:03,360
I should say it is clear with respect to the diseases of frailty, they're much, much more

1165
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:10,960
susceptible. Yeah, I think that's true. The cognitive part. I mean, in the calorie study,

1166
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,600
they did a little bit of cognitive research. But again, I, you know, these were people that

1167
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:22,400
weren't being restricted to the same extent. And, you know, the people in that society are very

1168
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:28,000
eager to be studied. The problem is, this is an uncontrolled experiment. Yeah, my guess is before

1169
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,040
they started calorie restriction, they were not your average person. No, of course, this is this

1170
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:39,120
health habits. Yeah, this is the poster child example for healthy user bias and epidemiology,

1171
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:44,800
we can learn virtually nothing from that without randomization. In terms of the immune system,

1172
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:52,160
though, I will have to say that I did ask a lot of people at the conference, how often do you get

1173
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:58,400
colds or the flu? And they say they don't. And I tend to believe them because I've never met a

1174
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:05,520
group of people that are fanatically attentive to their own health. Like if I said, what's your BMI,

1175
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:11,200
they could tell me to three decimal points and then say, well, do you mean in the morning or in

1176
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:17,200
the afternoon? You know, so when they tell me they haven't gotten a cold in five years, I believe them.

1177
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:24,320
Fair enough. I mean, this highlights an important point, right? Which is, one, it's a very, very,

1178
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,440
very rare subset of the population that is going to be able to adhere to 30%

1179
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:41,360
caloric restriction every minute of every day. And I would argue that even if you could,

1180
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:48,240
the quality of life might be not justified the trade off. Isn't there a joke that says caloric

1181
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:54,240
restriction will lengthen your life and it will feel like it or something to that? Like the,

1182
01:37:54,240 --> 01:38:00,240
yeah, what is it? But I think, you know, for these people, I don't think they perceive it.

1183
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:06,480
I don't think they miss it. No, no, no. My point is you couldn't extend, they are the subset who

1184
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,960
can do that. Yeah. To try to make that the solution for the rest of us who are interested

1185
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:20,880
in some form of zero protection. Yeah. It's a non-starter. Right. Yeah. Sort of, you know,

1186
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,000
constant caloric restriction isn't the answer. Right. So we now look to other things and you

1187
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
maybe heard me talk about this, but I kind of have this framework, right? That says on the one hand,

1188
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,800
we have this thing called the standard American diet, which is sort of the cesspool of nutrition

1189
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:42,160
we all live in. So that's the environment where food is infinitely abundant, infinitely cheap,

1190
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:49,840
infinitely palatable, and infinitely transportable. So meaning it's so processed that

1191
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:59,120
you can actually take it with you anywhere. Right. And it's hard to escape the gravitational pull

1192
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:07,120
of that. So we're all sort of in this orbit around the standard American diet. And there's basically

1193
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:14,320
a handful of ways out. So I think one avenue out of that is time restricted feeding, where you start

1194
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:19,840
to say, well, look, I'm not going to restrict what I'm eating. I'm not going to engage in any

1195
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:25,040
form of dietary restriction. I'm just going to limit the window in which I expose myself to this

1196
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:31,760
toxicity. So I'll not eat for 16 hours, but I will eat for eight hours. And you can obviously make

1197
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,240
that window narrow and narrow. And then there's the, then there's what I call dietary restriction.

1198
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:39,280
You and I use these terms a little differently, although I know what you're meaning when you say

1199
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:45,840
when I refer to dietary restriction, I mean, no attempt at reducing the content, but rather

1200
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,480
changing the mixture or quality. So dietary restriction, which is probably what most people

1201
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:56,640
think of when they think of a diet, like a paleo diet, a vegan diet, a keto diet, a low carb diet,

1202
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:01,520
they're not explicitly telling you to eat less. They're just telling you to not eat certain things.

1203
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:10,000
And so those two become, I think the mainstay of how most people are trying to escape the

1204
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,120
gravitational pull of the standard American diet. And then you can actually talk about intermittent

1205
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:21,440
forms of fasting. And that can be complete, such as, Hey, I'm not going to eat anything. I'm just

1206
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:26,560
going to have water for three days every month or every quarter. And they can be partial sort of

1207
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:34,880
like the fast mimicking diet where for five days you consume, you know, 750 calories. When you

1208
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:40,400
think about that entire landscape, where do you think we have the best insight about the health

1209
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:47,840
benefits? Well, first of all, these are all pretty new ideas. And I don't think they've had a lot of

1210
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,800
empirical testing at this point. And the empirical and testing that they have had is mostly been in

1211
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,920
people that already had some health issues that were diabetic or pre-diabetic or something like

1212
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:06,880
that. However, the logic of it is pretty compelling. And this is something we have learned from the

1213
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:16,240
mice. You know, from the mice, in the Rapamycin studies, we've learned how suppressing this gene

1214
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:24,400
called mTOR can have multiple health benefits. And now we know that it doesn't take that much

1215
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:32,960
fasting to also suppress mTOR. So we now kind of have an idea. So, you know, one of the things we

1216
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:39,280
should probably mention is that the people that were studying mice and rats, you know, years later

1217
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:43,520
started noticing, well, wait a second. And I noticed this one. We will go to feed these animals.

1218
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:48,800
They're right there. They're doing pull ups on the cage waiting for you to get the food. And,

1219
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:54,720
you know, literally within half an hour, all their food is gone. And what we never really

1220
01:41:54,720 --> 01:42:01,440
thought about until recently is, wait a second, maybe it's the timing that's the important thing,

1221
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:08,400
the fact that they're fasting for 23 hours a day or 23 and a half hours a day, maybe that more than

1222
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:14,080
the total consumption or as much as the total consumption is doing it. And now we kind of have

1223
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:22,160
a molecular mechanism for understanding how a period of fasting might have benefits and might

1224
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:27,600
have short-term benefits. I mean, I think that's one of the really interesting things is that these

1225
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:38,320
short-term fasts, whether they're a mice or humans seem to have multiple benefits. I mean, one of the,

1226
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,280
I think one of the most groundbreaking studies was by Jay Mitchell, unfortunately.

1227
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:50,080
Who just passed away a year. I mean, yeah. Yeah. Terrible, terrible. Bicycle, but he showed that

1228
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:56,400
if you fasted a mouse for two or three days, they recovered from surgery so much faster than.

1229
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,520
Well, actually, Steve, I mean, we should double click on that a little bit because it's not just

1230
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:04,960
that they recovered from surgery. They recovered from a lethal injury, right? There's one experiment

1231
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:10,160
where I think if I'm thinking of the right experiment, they took a group of mice that were

1232
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:15,280
constitutively calorically restricted their entire lives. They took another group that were fed ad-lib

1233
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,520
their whole lives. And then they took another group that were ad-lib fed, but I think three days

1234
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:25,840
prior to the surgery were severely calorically restricted. So each of them then had the same

1235
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:31,680
procedure, which was a laparotomy with a ligation of the femoral arteries for a period of time and

1236
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:37,200
then a reperfusion. So what, you know, for the folks listening, what that means is you clamp off

1237
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:41,280
all the blood supply to the lower part of the leg. And then, you know, basically just before the

1238
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:48,160
animal is about to die, you let it, you let the blood flow again. But because of all of the

1239
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:53,360
ischemic damage to the tissue, all the tissue damage due to no oxygen, you create such an

1240
01:43:53,360 --> 01:44:00,400
injury to the animal that I believe all of the ad-lib animals died from that. But yet the two

1241
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:06,080
groups that were calorically restricted, one its entire life and one just for three days survived,

1242
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:13,040
suggesting that just that period of caloric restriction could produce a similar benefit.

1243
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,640
Now I could be a little wrong on the numbers, but that was sort of the gist of my memory. Is that

1244
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:22,640
correct? Yeah. Well, what he did, it actually cut off blood supply of the kidneys. Was it the kidneys?

1245
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:28,880
Okay. Yeah. Another one that they did the liver. Okay. Same result though. And you're exactly

1246
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,560
right. They did these ones that have been calorically restricted their whole lives, the ones

1247
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:39,120
that had been, that were ad-lib and then the ones that have been fasted for, they did some that have

1248
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:44,800
been fast restricted for a few weeks and then some that had been just fasted water only fast for a

1249
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:51,680
day or three days for two or three days. That's a big fast per a mouse. It is a big fast. That's

1250
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:57,120
absolutely right. And they did much better. You're right. I don't remember if all of the controls

1251
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:05,120
died, but if not, almost all of them did. And the ones that were restricted lifetime or for two

1252
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:10,960
or three days, I think none of them died. So you're right. It's yeah. When I said a surgery, I guess I

1253
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:16,160
was thinking about it from a mouseologist standpoint where a lot of our surgeries don't turn out so

1254
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:22,160
well, but yeah, this wasn't a minor surgery that you expected everybody to recover from it.

1255
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:28,240
They really were expecting most of the mice were going to die and they did. So yeah, I mean,

1256
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:35,120
that kind of, I think it changed my thinking entirely about dietary restriction. And you're

1257
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:39,280
right. We use these in different terms. Initially it was called dietary restriction because they

1258
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:45,040
just restricted the amount of diet. But then after they decided it was calories that counted,

1259
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:51,760
then they started being called calorie restriction. And now probably not exactly calorie. So I don't

1260
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:57,120
know food restriction. Maybe we should call what they do to the mice at this point.

1261
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,840
Well, what's your take on the role of the macronutrients here? And I'll pass it to

1262
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:08,000
candidates to consider the first being a subset of amino acids, whether it be methionine,

1263
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:16,080
tryptophan, leucine would be candidates to consider. And then other things such as sugar.

1264
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:27,360
Again, the Wisconsin half of the monkey experiment certainly suggested that a reduction in sucrose,

1265
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:32,080
perhaps independent of calories, could have played a role, but it's difficult because we can't

1266
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:38,080
disentangle it from the weight loss and other things. But what do we know about amino acids

1267
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,480
and their role? We certainly know that mTOR, which you brought up a moment ago, is an amino acid

1268
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,480
sensor. So how do you think that fits in? Independent of calories, perhaps?

1269
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:55,280
Yeah, well, I think we need to work that out. Because there are these diets around and there

1270
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:59,520
are diets that say, Oh, what you want to do is you want to eat as many carbs as you can, and as

1271
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:06,640
little protein and fat as you can. And there are others that say the opposite. And I don't think

1272
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:13,280
the animal work is going to tell us a lot about that. I think we have to try to figure out

1273
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:21,600
how to do the experiments in people. We have to do it in healthy people. Because I think if we want

1274
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,480
to make sick people less sick, that's great, we should be doing that. But a lot of people that

1275
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:32,960
are healthy want to know how to stay healthy. And I think that we can't do these things long term,

1276
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:39,120
because what if you're in one that's turning out to be really bad for your health? What we need is

1277
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:45,200
we need some biomarkers, which you mentioned before. We need something so we can do an experiment

1278
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:51,520
of a few weeks or a few months and have the answer long term. And we need to do it in people

1279
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:57,760
of different ages as well. The thing that we didn't talk about, the calorie strategy,

1280
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:03,200
so those were done on people who were basically in their late 30s. And what's good for them is not

1281
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:09,520
necessarily good for what people in their 60s might want to do. You know, one of the things I think

1282
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:15,440
that the intervention testing program has demonstrated that shocking is how late in life

1283
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:21,440
you can start some kind of intervention and still have a dramatic improvement in health.

1284
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:29,760
And that to me has really major implications for people, right? Just because you're 50 years old

1285
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,640
and you've never done any exercise and you've eaten a terrible diet doesn't mean you can't improve

1286
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:43,360
your health a lot. So, because I think a lot of people feel that. I've done this my whole life, so

1287
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:52,880
what's the point in doing it now? You know, I'm curious for you, you know, I get to ask you a

1288
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:58,560
question occasionally here. What is the average age of people that come to your clinic? Are they

1289
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:06,320
people in their 30s or 40s or 70s or 80s? I think the median age in our practice

1290
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:20,560
is high 30s. Yeah. Would be median. And mean is probably a little bit higher. But range is 29 to

1291
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:29,120
79. 29 to 82 maybe is the range. Right. So that makes sense. So that's about the time in life where

1292
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:40,640
people start realizing they may not live forever, right? And start making some changes potentially

1293
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:47,680
in the way they live their life. You know, I have a dramatic memory of when I first detected aging

1294
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:58,000
in myself. What was that? And that was, I probably was 32 maybe, but it was during a basketball game.

1295
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:07,120
And I was always the quickest person on the floor. And I was used to blowing by people.

1296
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:14,480
And suddenly this person blew by me who was much bigger than me. And I was used to if anybody was

1297
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:18,320
going to be as quick as me, it was going to be somebody as small as me. And I thought, gosh,

1298
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:23,920
that had to be an accident. And then he did it again. And then he did it again. And I realized

1299
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:30,160
I lost a step. This is what they mean by aging. I have lost a step. There's, you know, and if you're

1300
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:35,200
a professional athlete, of course, you're tested much more often and you probably notice this much

1301
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:43,120
earlier than I did in a casual neighborhood basketball game. But it was a shocking moment

1302
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:48,720
to me because before then never entered my mind that my body was going to change in a way that

1303
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:55,680
would make it less good at things that used to do. Well, speaking of human longevity,

1304
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:59,840
Steve, what do you think is the best explanation for the sex difference between men and women?

1305
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,000
In the United States today and much of the developed world, it probably accounts for

1306
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,600
about two years of difference, doesn't it? More like five. Is it that much? Wow. Yeah.

1307
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:17,360
Okay. What's our best attribution? Well, it's a really interesting problem. And

1308
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:24,880
let's sort of talk about, I think, some myths about that difference. It's not that women

1309
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:31,680
survive better in an old age. They do, but they also survive better when they're infants and they

1310
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:36,960
also survive better when they're in their 20s and in their 30s and their 40s. So they survive better

1311
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:43,200
at every age and they survive better when times are good and during epidemics and during

1312
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:50,160
famines. And so there's something about their biology that allows them to survive better. And

1313
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:55,280
it doesn't seem to depend on conditions. That's very different from a lot of animals where

1314
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:00,960
it depends on the diet, it depends on the circumstances. We don't know any circumstances

1315
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:09,120
in which men survive better than women, even prematurely born infants. Being a male infant

1316
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:17,200
is a risk factor for dying if you're a preemie. So there's some robust feature of human biology

1317
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:24,240
at play here. And unfortunately, we don't really know what it is. We don't know, is it sex hormones?

1318
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:33,040
Is it something that happens before birth that we can't do anything about later? There's a little

1319
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:41,680
bit of weak, but I think maybe provocative evidence. There's at least two studies showing

1320
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:47,360
a major increase in longevity for men who were castrated for one reason or another.

1321
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,000
These were unique populations and maybe that has no relevance whatsoever. But that would

1322
01:52:54,640 --> 01:53:03,360
kind of put the onus on sex hormone. On the other hand, there's the hormone replacement

1323
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:11,840
work in human females, which suggests that, well, maybe replacing those hormones isn't

1324
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,280
such a great idea. So I don't think we know. So I'll tell you the three.

1325
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:21,520
I think we now don't find that to be the case. I think basically every conclusion of the

1326
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,880
original women's health initiative has been turned over, right?

1327
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:34,000
No, I would say that's not the case. But the key factor for the women's health initiative

1328
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,880
is the women didn't start doing it until 10 years after menopause, on average. And so there have been

1329
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:46,400
shorter term for women that start replacement therapy earlier and then stop it, that there may

1330
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:51,360
be this window in which it's benefited. But of course it depends on your family history.

1331
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:58,080
But my point is there was no increase in mortality. I think if you really scrutinize

1332
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:08,080
the WHI data correctly, even the most headline grabbing finding, which was that the women in the

1333
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:16,000
progesterone and conjugated equine estrogen group had a greater, 25% greater risk of breast cancer.

1334
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:22,000
I mean, I think we now understand that that was a very misleading finding.

1335
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:28,560
Yeah, I mean, there were several things that they were more likely to have a stroke. But you're

1336
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:35,840
right, the overall mortality rate at the time that they stopped the study because of the blood clots

1337
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,400
and the strokes, there was no difference. You're absolutely right about that. There was no difference

1338
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:47,040
in mortality and you could have made the case that they shouldn't have stopped it at that point.

1339
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,360
And it's interesting on the castrated study, on the castrated literature,

1340
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:00,320
the obvious one, the first or Occam's razor view of that would be, well, there's something about

1341
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:06,160
testosterone, right? Because it's not so much that the men who are castrated are getting estrogen and

1342
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:10,320
progesterone. If you castrate them, they're actually going to have no estradiol versus the

1343
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:16,560
estradiol they would have if they could keep their testosterone. But of course, that kind of flies in

1344
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:21,120
the face of the testosterone replacement data, which say, well, actually it doesn't seem to impact

1345
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:27,680
mortality either way, at least outside of two or three years. But then that comes to a point you

1346
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,600
made earlier, maybe it's something that happens early in life with high exposure.

1347
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,720
And yeah, I mean, to me, the telling

1348
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:44,640
data points are that the women survive better from ages zero to five. You know, that suggests to me

1349
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:51,040
that there's something already in place and it probably may not have anything to do. I mean,

1350
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:56,320
let me point out the two testosterone studies are very weak. They were not

1351
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:03,920
done with this in mind. They were done post hoc. There's a lot of complications. So I don't put a

1352
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:10,000
great deal of stock in those. It's just provocative. And also, I mean, the difference in longevity was

1353
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,560
something like 20 years and both of them. So it wasn't a trivial difference. But I can certainly

1354
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:23,200
understand why men would have a lower all-cause mortality or higher all-cause mortality when you

1355
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:32,240
factor in a couple of things. One is behaviors. I mean, if I compare my sons to my daughter,

1356
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,840
it's literally like they wake up every day trying to figure out how to hurt each other and hurt

1357
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:44,080
themselves. And I'm actually very fascinated by that, Steve, because I don't understand

1358
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:49,600
where that is in their genes. Like you would think, well, that has to be sex linked, right?

1359
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:58,640
But when you look at men who are double Ys, so there are some men who don't get an X chromosome,

1360
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:05,680
they get two Ys. They turn out to be no more aggressive than a standard XY. So it's not

1361
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:10,160
something as just as simple as like, well, that Y chromosome, it's going to be a little bit more

1362
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:16,400
nuanced than that. And I think about the dumb things I did growing up. There were literally

1363
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:22,640
times I was engaging in such stupid behavior, like into my late teens that it's a miracle I'm

1364
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:26,640
sitting here, at least when you almost died. Well, I guess we could argue that was kind of,

1365
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:32,880
maybe not the wisest behavior, but. Oh, you don't have any clue as to what the really dumbest stuff

1366
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:38,880
that I did. We used to, I used to be in a group of friends that hunted with bows and arrows,

1367
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:44,960
rabbits, when I lived in Florida. And we would take our bows and arrows and go into a vacant

1368
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,520
lot in the middle of the night when it was dark and shoot them straight up in the air and then

1369
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:54,720
stand around to see where they would come down. So they could have come down straight through the top

1370
01:57:54,720 --> 01:58:02,240
of our heads. And you look back and you go, yeah, what was going on? It's a miracle. Yeah, I say that

1371
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,960
I call this testosterone dementia. And I think probably most men go through it at some point,

1372
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:13,600
you know, in their, probably in their adolescent years, right? Yeah. When I was in high school,

1373
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:18,480
one of the things we used to do, there's this huge train in Toronto called the GO train.

1374
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:23,840
And it was the above ground transit train. And we used to play this game. As soon as you got off it,

1375
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:30,240
you would dive underneath it and see who could lay the most coins on the track and then get out such

1376
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:36,400
that when it started rolling, you'd get whoever had the most flattened coins would win. Can you

1377
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:44,080
believe that for a moment? Like it's just not hard to believe that that a subset of our species could

1378
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:51,360
be so stupid to do something like that. Yeah, we would also shoot arrows at one another on purpose

1379
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:56,720
and dodge them. And that ended because I was the first one that didn't dodge well enough when I got

1380
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:02,240
an arrow stuck in my leg, at which point our parents investigated what we'd been up to. And

1381
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:08,400
that was the end of that. Yeah. And like, do you think in the history of the, how many billion

1382
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:13,760
people have lived? Like eight billion? Oh, there's almost eight billion alive now. There's probably

1383
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:19,280
probably 800 billion. Yeah. So when you think of all the people that have lived, half of them being

1384
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:26,560
women, do you think there is one example of a woman doing something so stupid? I can't imagine.

1385
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:31,760
Hard to imagine. Yeah. But to get back to it. But that's not all of it, right? That doesn't

1386
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:41,600
explain the infant mortality in the NICU, right? Right. And it doesn't explain the lower influenza

1387
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:49,120
deaths. It doesn't explain the lower, I mean, COVID was, if you look at the COVID, so women are

1388
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:56,480
dying at about 45%, men about 55%. That's pretty much what it looks like for the flu. And I mean,

1389
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:04,080
if you look at all the major causes of death, women die at a lower rate, even if you adjust for age,

1390
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:09,680
so you take age out of the equation, then men for all of them, with the exception of Alzheimer's

1391
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:19,120
disease, which is really interesting to me. And it makes me actually, my private hypothesis that

1392
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:24,960
I don't think I've ever said publicly before is I think Alzheimer's disease is going to turn out to

1393
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:31,360
have an autoimmune component, because that's the kind of thing that women seem to be more prone to

1394
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:41,920
than men is some of the autoimmune diseases. So I mean, there's a few possibilities here. There's

1395
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:47,120
one idea that it has to do with the fact that women have a redundant set of genes on their

1396
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:55,360
second X chromosome. So if they have a defective gene or genes on one of the X chromosomes,

1397
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,640
the other one can compensate for it to a certain extent.

1398
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,200
If that's true, I don't know if we have enough men with Kline filters out there, but

1399
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:08,720
that would be an interesting comparative analysis, right? Just for folks listening,

1400
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:14,800
men with Kline filters, instead of having XY have XXY. So they would also have that same

1401
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:21,920
redundancy of genes. Right. But some of those redundancies might be bad because Kline filters,

1402
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,960
those people don't live long for certain. I don't know how short live they might be,

1403
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,560
but they're not longer. I didn't realize their lifespan. I mean, they certainly have a unique

1404
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,840
phenotype, but I didn't realize they lived shorter. Certainly. Yeah. But that's interesting because

1405
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:42,640
women with turners, right, which is X, which is aneuploidy of X only, one X, they definitely live

1406
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:51,280
shorter, don't they? Right. Right. So that's one idea. And a little bit of support for it is if you

1407
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:58,960
look at, so one of the X chromosomes typically gets inactivated in each cell and it tends to be random.

1408
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:07,440
As people get older, as women get older, there tends to be a bias in one or the other X chromosome.

1409
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:15,040
So one is inactivated more than the other. Early in life seems to be random. Half of the cells,

1410
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:21,520
your paternal X is inactivated. Half of it is your maternal X. But over time, you get a

1411
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:27,840
kind of a selection for one or the other. Maybe that might be it. The other thing is that there

1412
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:34,880
might be an issue of compatibility of the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome,

1413
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:41,200
because mitochondrial genomes only get passed from female to female through generations, right?

1414
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:47,200
So you'd expect there would be a lot of selection for excellent compatibility. Now, the mitochondria

1415
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:53,760
that end up in males are at a dead end. So they don't, you know, it may be that the male

1416
02:02:54,480 --> 02:03:00,880
nuclear genome is just not as compatible with the mitochondrial genome as the female genome.

1417
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:09,040
So that's the other possibility that I find kind of, I find both of those really interesting and

1418
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:16,160
what we really need to know about is we need to know a lot more about this in X inactivation,

1419
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:21,520
because it's not total. Not every gene on the second X is inactivated, only some of them.

1420
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:28,880
But the other thing is the Y chromosome is, this has got to be the first time in the history of

1421
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:34,320
medicine that men get less attention for anything than women. But we've always assumed the Y

1422
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:40,960
chromosome is about sexual characteristics. But we now know there are at least nine genes on the Y

1423
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,840
chromosome that are expressed in every tissue. We have no idea what they're doing in all those

1424
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:52,320
tissues, but maybe they're doing something that's not so good for us in some of those tissues.

1425
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:56,160
I find both of those ideas, Steve, incredibly fascinating. I'd never,

1426
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:01,760
I'd never thought of either. The mitochondrial incompatibility is a brilliant one. I'll have

1427
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:07,280
to think for a moment about how, what experiments one could do to test that. But on the other one,

1428
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:18,400
on the dominant X, it would be interesting to follow women and identify ones who partition

1429
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:25,360
more into a dominant maternal X and then a dominant paternal X in the women who have a

1430
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:32,480
dominant paternal X. Presumably, that X is better than the other X. And then I would like to see if

1431
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:38,560
there's a difference in the longevity of that father versus, and it's not a random experiment,

1432
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:44,800
so it sort of sucks, but is that a better surviving male than another male that's otherwise

1433
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:52,480
comparable? That's one way I would try to get at that. Yeah. I mean, I think this is a really

1434
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:59,200
intriguing area of research and something that we could do now that we couldn't do a long time ago.

1435
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:05,360
The limitation, of course, because it's humans, is that we're kind of stuck with doing that in blood

1436
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:09,440
and we don't know if the same thing might be going on in the brain or the liver.

1437
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:20,480
Although again, I guess from autopsy studies, we could probably figure that out now. But we do have

1438
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:26,640
the tools now to do a lot of this. We could do muscle biopsies. Is it the same in the blood and

1439
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:36,800
the muscle? That's a possibility. So, you know, my feeling is that we have yet to really explore

1440
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:46,000
these sex differences in any depth and that we may end up having somewhat different therapeutics

1441
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:54,000
in women and men once we start looking into exactly how these things work out between the sexes.

1442
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:02,880
Now, the ITP vary consistently, even whether you talk about its home run drugs like rapamycin

1443
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,080
and other drugs like recently 17 alpha estradiol,

1444
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:16,960
they disproportionately favor the male mice over the female mice. Do you believe that that is

1445
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,320
simply the result of the fact that they have a higher bar to clear with the females?

1446
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:35,600
Possibly, because in the ITP the female mice live longer. So, it's the longer life sex that's

1447
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:43,040
having no effect and shorter life sex is having the bigger effect. A really interesting one is

1448
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:50,880
rapamycin because you know in rapamycin the sex bias is very, in longevity at least, is very dose

1449
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:58,560
dependent. At the lowest dose they've done, the females live substantially longer than the, or

1450
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:04,880
put it this way, the effect of substantially bigger in females than in males. And that difference

1451
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:10,480
gradually goes away as you get it to a higher and higher dose. And in the highest dose that

1452
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:20,320
anybody has used, which is not in the ITP, but in another study, males had a big effect and females

1453
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:27,440
had no effect. So, the idea is maybe you've overdosed the females at that stage. Now, do you

1454
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:35,600
recall that in the ITP the females had a much higher plasma level than the males despite

1455
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:41,920
consuming the same amount? And I don't remember if Rich had an explanation for why that was the case.

1456
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:50,640
Do you? No, I don't think that they have an explanation. But that could explain the difference,

1457
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:58,720
right? It could be that it wasn't that at a lower dose females are living longer because it's a

1458
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:03,280
lower dose. It's because they have a higher plasma concentration. And maybe that's the gap that

1459
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,480
vanishes at a high enough dose. I don't know because I don't know what the kinetics were

1460
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:16,880
in the other study. And what they've published, it wasn't related to blood levels of rapamycin or

1461
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:26,400
metabolites. There was something else is going on. But those things get metabolized very quickly

1462
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:35,120
and there's lots of downstream things that could be. But again, I think that mice are a particularly

1463
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:43,200
bad place to look for these sex differences. And that's because, as I said in the ITP, the

1464
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:49,280
females live longer. But if you look at all the mice studies together, there's mice studies in

1465
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,600
which males live longer, mouse studies in which there's no difference, mouse studies in which

1466
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:59,680
females live longer. And they're all over the place. And it's not a genotype thing. Because I

1467
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:07,600
once looked at 30 black six mouse studies and you found the same range from males living 25% longer

1468
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:14,480
to females living 25% longer. And we don't know what that's a result of. Is it something in the

1469
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:24,480
diet? Is it something in the bedding? Or who knows? But the other thing is that mouse sex chromosomes

1470
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:30,160
are quite a bit different than human sex chromosomes. Just to give you an example,

1471
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:38,080
some genes on the X chromosome do not get inactivated on the inactive X. About 15%.

1472
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:45,040
You know, you get expression in both sexes. In mice, that's about 3% to 4% of the genes on the

1473
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:52,640
X chromosome get inactivated. There are also genes on the Y chromosome in humans that are not on the

1474
02:09:53,200 --> 02:10:00,800
Y chromosome in mice and vice versa. So I'm not, this again is one of these things where I think

1475
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:06,880
of this as looking at the world through one eye. We have one comparison with humans. Now it's mice.

1476
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:12,720
And just like you don't have much perspective when you close one eye, I don't think you have

1477
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:17,680
much perspective when you have one comparison. And that's kind of what we have now.

1478
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:24,960
Why do you think it's been, I don't want to say so difficult because I don't know that we've tried,

1479
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:31,120
frankly. But why do you think there hasn't been a greater effort in identifying better biomarkers

1480
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:36,240
of aging? Or do you think that there has been an enormous effort and it's just been too difficult?

1481
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:46,880
But for example, we don't know how long one as a human needs too fast to achieve a significant

1482
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:54,320
inhibition of rapamycin to extract the benefits that we think are there. Why is that?

1483
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:02,480
Well, I would say that of your two alternatives that we haven't tried hard enough or maybe we've

1484
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:08,960
tried hard enough and haven't found anything, I would say it's the latter. Because in the 1990s,

1485
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:14,480
the NIA put I think $100 million into developing biomarkers of aging and it came out with nothing.

1486
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:21,520
But that may have been that we just didn't have the right tools at that point. I think

1487
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:28,160
we're really on the verge of something big here so that we can have biomarkers that will tell us

1488
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:33,440
exactly this kind of thing. And do you think these biomarkers will be in the metabolome,

1489
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:41,360
in the proteome, in the epigenome, all of the above? I think they're, yeah, I think they're

1490
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:49,440
likely to be all of the above. And right now, the hottest one is in the epigenome

1491
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,720
because that's looking better and better and it seems to...

1492
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:58,960
Are you optimistic? I mean, I've seen how easy it is to manipulate those and I find it completely

1493
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,120
uninteresting. And that's going to alienate a lot of people that are listening to this because I'm

1494
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:08,800
the naysayer on that. But Steve, when I look at those data, I'm not remotely impressed. And by

1495
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:15,520
the way, I've done the experiments on some of my patients. You measure their epigenetic age on day

1496
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:22,960
zero. They do a three-day fast. You measure their epigenetic age. It goes down by 10% or more,

1497
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:28,320
frankly. Have you really learned anything? And then a week later, it's back to normal.

1498
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:34,320
I don't know what that's telling me. Well, it may be... So I'm actually fairly

1499
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:39,440
impressed by the epigenetic data, but maybe it's not going to work in the short term like that.

1500
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,280
This may be something that tells you something over the course of years, but not over the course of

1501
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:51,440
weeks or months. I think my only point there is that it's very sensitive to what's happening in

1502
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:57,120
the moment. And so when I look at a lot of these aging clocks and I look at the inputs,

1503
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:03,920
I think to myself, these are very easy to manipulate. What was your vitamin D level on

1504
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,040
this day? What was your glucose level at the moment of that blood test? I mean, these things

1505
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:15,200
are so easy to manipulate and they have so much volatility over time that I don't find them to be

1506
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:22,480
clinically quite useful. Well, they may never turn out to be clinically useful because it may be that

1507
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:30,240
they're integrating things over a time scale that's not clinically meaningful. I think the

1508
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:36,560
likelihood that we're going to find something in the proteome and the metabolome is higher. I mean,

1509
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:44,000
something that's therapeutically useful just because those things really change rapidly.

1510
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:55,440
Yeah. And if we want to know, if you do X for the... If you fast six hours, you fast 12 hours,

1511
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:59,920
I think what you're going to look for there is changes in gene activity.

1512
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:08,400
And that's going to be in the proteome or in the metabolome. The thing is, it's going to be

1513
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:15,840
computationally complex. Now we have all these tools for doing computationally complex things,

1514
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:21,600
but they're not cheap tools. And so I don't know how long before they'll be in the clinic where

1515
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:31,760
we can afford to do this in people amass. If I were, you know, Czar for a day and could

1516
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:39,760
marshal the resources for the Manhattan Project on longevity, this would be one of the departments.

1517
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:44,480
Right? Like this would be, you know, if you had a billion dollars to put towards a Manhattan

1518
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:51,920
Project of longevity, I feel like a quarter of it would go into this problem. Yeah. Because it,

1519
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:57,200
again, if we're interested in longevity, presumably we're interested in human longevity.

1520
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:01,680
And if we're interested in human longevity, we don't have a hundred years to come up with the

1521
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:08,080
answer. So we have to come up with markers that are better. Well, and now we have the tools to do

1522
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:13,440
that. Yeah. You know, every year the tools, the computational tools, the analytic tools, you know,

1523
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:20,880
if you can detect, you know, 3000 different proteins in your blood, then you're much more

1524
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:26,560
likely to detect something that's really, really meaningful. And so those things are all happening.

1525
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:31,200
Of course, they could happen more if there were more money invested in them.

1526
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:37,360
I think that's the big issue, Steve, personally. I think this is not commercially interesting enough.

1527
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:42,640
And I think that that's why it hasn't gotten the attention. I mean, I think the diagnostics space

1528
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:47,120
is a lousy space, right? Like if you're a venture capitalist and someone comes up to you and says,

1529
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:51,280
I've got a new diagnostic test. I mean, that's nowhere near as interesting as I have a new

1530
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,720
therapeutic model. Right. And that's why I feel like this could only really occur in kind of a

1531
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:03,600
Manhattan project or a heavily funded government project. But I just don't. And I use the term

1532
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:09,920
Manhattan project, meaning an entity that is so large commercially that they understand that this

1533
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:16,640
is an important tool that needs to be developed in our research to foster the development of,

1534
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:21,680
you know, molecules down the line. Yeah, it's an interesting, you know, I mean, Craig Venter tried

1535
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:28,480
to do that, right? And that corporation company, we know why I have thoughts on that. I can't share

1536
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:37,440
publicly, but but you're right. I mean, I think the key the keys got to be there. This is not magic.

1537
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:42,880
You know, there's stuff going on in the body. I think the blood, because it courses through

1538
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:48,400
everything in the body, is going to have clues to what's going on everywhere. Once we've learned how

1539
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:56,560
to read those clues. And I think part of the problem is that we're not, you know, there's a

1540
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:02,240
very small group of people that are interested in making other people live longer. But most of the

1541
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:07,440
time, it's trying to prevent them from getting a specific disease. There's a lot more money that

1542
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:13,760
goes into obesity, I think, than that goes into longevity. And it's hard to say that it's not

1543
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:21,760
well spent money because obesity is the huge problem. Right. So you you you made a very famous

1544
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:28,640
bet with Jay Ashonsky 20 years ago, right? 21 years ago. Yeah. What was that bet?

1545
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:36,560
The bet was about when the first when we would have the first 150 year old human. Which side of

1546
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:44,240
that bet did you fall on? I was on this. So my part of the bet was I think that person was born

1547
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:51,920
in the 20, already was born by the year 2000. The person is already alive, who would ultimately

1548
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:59,680
become the first 150 year old person. And Jay bet the opposite. And the critical thing was the person

1549
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:06,240
had to be mentally competent enough to carry on a sensible conversation about something.

1550
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:15,120
Yeah, so that was 20 years ago. And nobody's lived as long as the longest live person had lived at

1551
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:23,120
that point since then. Which was about 122. Yeah, 122 and a half, roughly. Nobody's even reached

1552
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:33,120
120 since then. And so yeah, I'm asked quite awfully if I still think I'm right. And I do

1553
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:42,240
because I never thought this was going to happen because we got better at treating cancer, or we

1554
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:47,600
got better at preventing heart disease. I always thought it was going to happen because we would

1555
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:55,680
develop something or some things that would fundamentally change the rate of aging. And we

1556
02:18:55,680 --> 02:19:01,680
haven't developed that yet. We've got a lot of clues. And I think we're getting closer and closer

1557
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:07,520
and closer. But the other reason I'm still confident that I'm going to win that bet is that one of the

1558
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:13,200
things that's come out of the interventions testing program is that things can have this big effect

1559
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:20,160
started late in life. So it may be that this doesn't happen until the person that was born in 2001

1560
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:28,240
is 50 years old. But if it happens, then that doesn't mean that they still couldn't live 150

1561
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:33,680
years. Now it's important to note because this wager gets mischaracterized something. I'm not

1562
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:38,720
saying that I think the life expectancy. That's right. You're talking about 150. Yeah, yeah,

1563
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:45,040
I'm talking about a single person, probably a Japanese woman. It would be my guess if I

1564
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:52,080
had to guess right now. I don't think that 150 year life expectancy is in our future. What do

1565
02:19:52,080 --> 02:20:00,880
you think is the limit of human life expectancy as we currently exist? Maybe 100 years. I think

1566
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:10,400
that's reasonable. Now if that happens, some people will live 150 years. Yeah. Right. It's

1567
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:17,280
like the average is around 80 now and this one person lived 122 years. So I think if we get to 100,

1568
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:28,880
that seems conceivable to me. And also something that could be reached by getting better at what

1569
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:35,280
we do now. The key thing is getting people to do what we know is better for them. Now,

1570
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:43,280
do you understand the math behind Jay's models that say if we completely eradicated cancer,

1571
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:49,280
we would increase life expectancy by X years. If we completely eradicated disease Y, we would

1572
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:55,520
increase. And the numbers are very small in his estimates, but I've never actually taken the time

1573
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:01,360
to look at the models to see where those numbers come from. Yeah, those models rely on a number of

1574
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:07,680
assumptions. One of the assumptions of each of these is independent of the other. Which is

1575
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:18,560
completely untrue. Metabolic syndrome tells us that's untrue. Right. So eliminating a single cause

1576
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:25,120
of death is not the same as delaying 20 causes of death. Yeah. Right. So I think they're kind of

1577
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:35,760
artificial in that respect. So those give me no pause for possibly winning my bet. So when you

1578
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:46,880
think about existing molecules, i.e. molecules that are either FDA approved or like 17 alpha

1579
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:51,920
estradiol is not an FDA approved molecule, but it's been tested and it's had unbelievable success

1580
02:21:51,920 --> 02:22:01,200
in male mice in the ITP. When you think about kinagaflozin, acarbose, of course rapamycin, metformin.

1581
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:09,600
What molecule do you think of the molecules we know about today has the most potential

1582
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:15,920
for giro protection? Certainly, if we go by the mouse date, it would have to be rapamycin.

1583
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:21,840
If we go by the human date, it would have to be metformin. Both of those are weak statement.

1584
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:28,560
In my qualifications for each of those is a pretty major qualifications. I actually think that

1585
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:36,720
what might turn out to be the most helpful is combinations of these things. So rapamycin plus

1586
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:45,840
metformin. What I like about metformin is that the most compelling data come from human studies,

1587
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:51,440
not from mouse studies. The mouse data on metformin are weak. It didn't succeed in the

1588
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:57,520
ITP, were you surprised by that? No. I wasn't surprised by that at all.

1589
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:03,760
I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work out in humans. Just because most clinical trials don't,

1590
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:09,360
I mean the existing data, which is voluminous and all pretty much points in one direction, which is

1591
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:15,680
that it's going to be beneficial. Again, it all comes from people that are taking metformin because

1592
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:21,600
they're diabetic. This could be a lot like the Wisconsin experiment again, where it's not going

1593
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:26,640
to work if you do it on people who are healthy. Right. Now, Nier would argue against that, right?

1594
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:32,080
Nier would say that there are many benefits that we see in metformin that go far beyond its

1595
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:38,400
glucose regulatory benefits. They're the obvious benefit that the diabetic patients get.

1596
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:42,240
Yeah. No, no. Nier would be quite emphatic about disagreeing with me on this.

1597
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:49,760
I'd love to be wrong about that, but if I had to put my money, it's just because most clinical

1598
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:56,800
trials fail. Most clinical trials fail because they were based on mouse data to start off with,

1599
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:03,360
at least. Maybe this is something ... It's certainly worth figuring out, just because the

1600
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:10,320
effects are so manifold. It's dementia and cancer and heart disease, and we don't know what else.

1601
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:17,120
We don't know, for instance, what it might do to muscle function. The best data on that,

1602
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:23,040
it's not good for muscle function, but again, that comes from early work, and I think we have

1603
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:31,440
a long ways to go. Because it's so safe, that's the big thing about metformin, is that we know

1604
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:37,760
it's extremely safe. It's been taken by millions of people. We don't know that about rapamycin yet,

1605
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:45,200
but I think it ought to be a high priority to find out what low dose rapamycin does.

1606
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:54,960
The trouble is, giving drugs of any sort to completely healthy people is something that

1607
02:24:54,960 --> 02:25:01,120
the FDA is not going to go for. We're almost going to have to work these things out on people that

1608
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:08,640
have some sort of illnesses to start off with. How would you dose rapamycin in a longevity trial,

1609
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:15,600
just as a thought experiment, given two pieces of evidence that seem

1610
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:24,640
to be at dialectical odds with each other? They are as follows. In the mice studies,

1611
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:32,560
in all of the ITP studies, the animals were fed rapamycin in their chow, meaning they received

1612
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:40,160
rapamycin every day. They were always eating rapamycin. Based on our mechanistic understanding

1613
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:47,120
of rapamycin, we believe that the benefits come not from global inhibition of mTOR, but from the

1614
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:51,920
inhibition of mTOR complex one, and not the inhibition of mTOR complex two. In fact, the

1615
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:58,000
inhibition of mTOR complex two might actually have some negative consequences. If you were to take

1616
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:05,360
constitutively rapamycin, as patients do with organ transplants, you were suppressing both.

1617
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:11,040
How do you reconcile those two, and how would you design a clinical trial to address this if your

1618
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:18,000
stated purpose was increasing longevity? Well, the first thing I would do is I would start off

1619
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:25,440
with a dose that's already been tested in human for its effects and enhancing vaccine response

1620
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:31,600
to influenza, because they did multiple doses. That wasn't rapamycin, that was a rapalog.

1621
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:39,280
So five milligrams of everolimus and 20 milligrams of everolimus given once a week did just that.

1622
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:46,080
Right. And the lower dose was just effective at boosting immune response, as the higher dose,

1623
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:52,960
and had fewer side effects. So I would start off with that episodically, like they did, because I

1624
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:57,920
think there's some evidence that you're getting just as big a boost from that. Without the side

1625
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:04,080
effects. Without the side effects. And also, I think you can imagine how much the drug companies

1626
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:12,560
are working to find a rapablog that doesn't inhibit complex two. I mean, that's going to be

1627
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:18,160
huge if they can come up with something that works really differentially on complex one.

1628
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:25,280
That's really where I would start. I think those vaccine studies were a great start. And if they

1629
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:30,560
would, because they were, those were healthy people, right? They just were older people,

1630
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:37,280
they were people, I think 65 and older. I would like to see those things continued.

1631
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:43,280
Now it's interesting, a number of years ago, we tried to get funding for what I thought was

1632
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:50,000
a really good rapamycin study, but we were unsuccessful, which is that there was an NIH

1633
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:56,320
clinical trial to look at rapamycin as preventative for the reoccurrence of kidney cancer.

1634
02:27:56,880 --> 02:28:02,400
Those are people that already had a kidney removed, but were seemingly cured. But they

1635
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:10,240
have a higher than average rate of relapse. They were giving one year of rapamycin to see

1636
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:17,760
if it reduced that. And I said, wait a second, why don't we jump in and measure inflammation,

1637
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:23,200
muscle strength, you name it, all these things in this experiment that was already ongoing.

1638
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:28,960
But unfortunately, that didn't get funded. But on the other hand, it may have been too high a dose,

1639
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:33,680
because this is a therapeutic dose for immunosuppressive purposes, right? So it

1640
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,600
may not have been the right dose anyway. So we might have come to a conclusion

1641
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:45,760
that was misleading. I thought that that vaccination study was a great avenue for starting

1642
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:54,400
a longer term study. And I know they're doing some of that in a private company,

1643
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:55,600
spin off from-

1644
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:58,800
Yeah. Are you excited about the SGLT2 inhibitors?

1645
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:10,800
I think it's a little early to tell. That and the NAD, various NAD precursors,

1646
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:20,880
I think it's a little too early. So scientists are often, by temperament and training,

1647
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:27,040
extremely skeptical. And I think that's why we make boring interviews so often.

1648
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:34,640
We don't ever come down and make a clean statement. But I really need to see the data

1649
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:42,720
before I start to get excited. And I never get excited by a single mouse study. I get intrigued,

1650
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,400
but I don't get excited.

1651
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:49,040
Although the human data on the SGLT2 inhibitors is also remarkable. I think that's-

1652
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:49,680
Yeah.

1653
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:57,840
That's the theme here, is you have a great ITP outcome. And of course, the human data are not

1654
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,840
for longevity, but they're-

1655
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:00,000
Right.

1656
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,080
Again, they suffer the limitations of all human studies, namely that they're being used in a

1657
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:11,040
subset of the population that might not be the subset of interest. But the impact on kidney

1658
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:17,600
failure, all-cause mortality, heart failure is pretty impressive. And I think what's interesting

1659
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:24,880
about what the ITPs show us with both kinagaflozin and acarbos is that the benefits might not have

1660
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:31,520
to do anything with reducing caloric intake, which was the proposed reason for acarbos,

1661
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:36,080
but rather has to do with glucose kinetics. And I find that very fascinating, actually.

1662
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:44,640
I do too. And I have to say, I'm disappointed in the ITP that they dropped their parafed arm of

1663
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:51,120
that. When they started off, there was going to be a parafed arm and they dropped that. And I'm a bit

1664
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:58,000
disappointed because we don't know now, we only have body weight. We don't have food consumption.

1665
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:04,080
So we don't know how much of these effects might be due to food consumption and how many might not

1666
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:15,360
be. Or changes in the temporal pattern of food consumption. Maybe if it makes your stomach feel

1667
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:23,920
a little bit queasy, you don't want to eat again for 20 hours. So the human data, I mean, we're

1668
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:30,400
going to make real progress when we have human biomarkers. And we can do a five-year study and

1669
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:37,360
we can say, we know this is going to decrease dementia, heart disease, cancer, preserve muscle

1670
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:44,400
strength, boost immune response. Not just immune system, because we have to be careful of that. I

1671
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:48,720
think people think, oh yeah, we want to boost the immune system. Well, we don't want autoimmune

1672
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:56,160
diseases. We don't want our immune system to go haywire because it mischaracterized something as

1673
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:03,520
an invasion. But we want to boost immune responsiveness, certainly. Yeah, I think the

1674
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:11,040
limiting factor right now is biomarkers. Well, yeah, you know my feelings on that. So I think

1675
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:19,440
we end on the same page there, Steve. This has been a lot of fun and we're long overdue to share

1676
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:22,960
a dinner and continue these discussions. So hopefully the next time it'll be in person.

1677
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:27,040
That's great. Next time in New York, Austin, wherever.

1678
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:31,360
Perfect. All right. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I'm sure everybody enjoyed this as much as I did.

1679
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:37,600
Well, great talking to you, Peter. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.
