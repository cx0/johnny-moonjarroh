00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,880
Dr. Rosenberg, thank you so much for making time. I know how busy you are. I know as much

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,320
as anybody how busy you are because I've sat next to you and watched how hard you work and

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,120
how tirelessly you work. So it really means a lot that you would make any amount of time

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,440
to sit and talk about what we're going to talk about today. I almost don't know where

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,160
to begin, but I can't help but want to begin chronologically with your life story because

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,120
you're probably one of the most focused people I've ever met, if not the most focused person

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,840
I've ever met. And that focus seems to have started at a very young age. Let's talk a

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
little bit about your childhood. You grew up in the Bronx, if I'm not mistaken, correct?

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,360
That's correct. I was born in the Bronx. If I recall, we're coming up to your 81st

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,320
birthday. So you were born, I think it's August 1st, 1940.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,880
August 2nd, 1940.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,800
Yeah. So what are your earliest memories of childhood as they pertain both to your love

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,280
of science and perhaps more importantly, your obsession with cancer?

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,840
So up until about the age of five or six, I wanted to be a cowboy. I have an older brother,

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,400
and we would talk about going out West together and riding on horses and doing all kinds of

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:31,640
exciting things. But the first things I remember, other than wanting to be a cowboy, occurred

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,880
when I was about five or six years old. And I've given a lot of thought to how that came

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:48,880
to pass. When I was about five or six, living at home, right at the end of the Second World War,

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:59,040
when all of the remarkable tragedies of the Holocaust sort of came home as my parents got

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,600
one postcard after another. I remember this, and they're suffering as they got word of relatives

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:18,000
that died in the death camps during the war. And I remember being so horrified by that

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,320
in terms of how evil people could be towards one another. And somewhere around that time,

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:36,800
I developed an almost spiritual desire to become a doctor, to do research and make progress in

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:47,360
helping people in alleviating suffering rather than causing suffering. And that persisted.

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,240
As I began to keep scrapbooks about anything I could find about medicine or research,

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:08,000
and I think it was in response to the horrors of that particular time that inspired me to not only

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,360
become a doctor, but to become a doctor who not only helped alleviate suffering now, but alleviate

29
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
potential suffering in the future by doing research. And I stuck with that right through

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,160
my education. Now, you did very well in high school because, or at least we've never spoken

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,600
about it, but I can only assume you did because you were accepted to the best medical school. And

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,800
not only that, but you did the combined bachelor's MD degree, which I assume would have been very

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,960
difficult to go straight into medical school from high school. But you somehow managed to

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
get into this six-year program. And so just talking about Hopkins for a moment,

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,960
what was the impression that that place left on you in what would have been, I guess, the late

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,800
fifties and early sixties? So I went into this six-year program. It was three years of college

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,640
and three years of medical school, knowing that I would want to get further education,

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,920
that I would take additional time. And I knew from the very beginning that I would go on to

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,200
get a PhD in one of the sciences. It turned out to be biophysics. And Hopkins was a very

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,400
nurturing environment with respect to that. As soon as I got to Hopkins, I started working

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,560
in a biology laboratory in the afternoons and evenings doing some very simple projects

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,760
in the biology lab. But I knew from the very beginning that I wasn't just going to try to

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
practice today's science, practice today's medicine, but rather try to create the medicine

44
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,520
of tomorrow. And that stuck with me for these last 60 or 70 years or so.

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
Who was the chief of surgery when you were there? Was Blalock still the chief of surgery?

46
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,200
Alfred Blalock, yes. And the medical school was not necessarily a terribly nurturing environment.

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,840
You were thrown in there and at rounds there seemed to be a spirit of

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,080
calling people to task in front of others. It wasn't the way that I thought education should

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,640
happen, but there were brilliant people around. And that's what I think is the most, probably one

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,560
of the single most important components of a good education. And that is being surrounded by people

51
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,920
who know a lot, know more than you, can inspire you. And that kind of person was at Hopkins.

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
Now, I remember when I was in medical school, when I was spending time with you and we got talking

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,920
one night and you explained that the reason you chose to do your PhD at Harvard in biophysics,

54
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,360
and this is as close to my remember as a direct quote as possible is,

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,760
you never wanted to be intimidated by a differential equation, which presumably was

56
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:11,600
a bit of a shortcut for you wanted the biggest or the broadest education possible. But what led to

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
that choice? I mean, at that point in time, for example, did you know you had an interest

58
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,640
in immunology? Have that piqued your curiosity yet? Or were you still thinking just more broadly?

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,280
I knew I was somehow interested in the mysteries of cancer through high school biology and in my

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:40,480
college, in my college classes. I got a PhD because I wanted more formal learning. I never wanted to

61
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:50,560
be intimidated by what I did not know. I wanted to be able to grasp any area of science and use

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,280
it to answer questions. And maybe differential equations were in the source of that. I ended up

63
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,160
doing a lot of math in graduate school, but it was more than that. I wanted to have the feeling

64
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,040
that I had a good enough broad background in the sciences because when I got that PhD in biophysics,

65
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,240
I was doing physical chemistry, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics. It was a lot of nonbiology in

66
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,960
biophysics. I wanted to have a background in the sciences such that if I encountered a problem,

67
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,360
I could get a good book, read some papers and understand it. And it was that base of knowledge

68
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:39,840
that I tried to acquire. So when you were doing your PhD, had you already applied to residency

69
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,320
or did you take time out between medical school and the application to residency?

70
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,640
So I went immediately into the surgical residency at the Peter Ben Brigham Hospital right out of

71
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,760
medical school and then took off four years to get a PhD in biophysics. So it was a year of

72
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,520
internship, took off four years and then went back to the residency and then came down to the NIH

73
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,760
for several years to join the immunology branch here. This was during the Vietnam War before

74
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,360
going back to actually finish the residency in 1974. Now was Franny Moore sort of the most

75
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,320
significant figure in your life at that point in time as a mentor? Franny Moore was the chief of

76
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,480
surgery and an incredibly smart person. There are an awful lot of smart people in that

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,720
educational system, but Franny stood out in that discussing a problem, discussing a patient,

78
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,200
it wouldn't be at all surprising for him to come up with an idea or an outlook or a perspective on

79
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,160
a problem that most people had not considered. So in that sense, he was an important figure. He was

80
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:06,640
not so much loved as respected, which is a feature that I think can be very inspiring to young people.

81
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,480
And was it unusual for someone to leave their internship or leave after their internship and

82
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,600
go into a PhD program at that time? Well, it was as a matter of fact. Brigham encouraged you to take

83
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,960
off a year or sometimes two years in the middle of the residency program, generally after two or

84
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,720
three years. But I knew at that point, I was just itching to learn more. I was just not satisfied

85
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,800
after medical school, the college and medical school, that I really knew enough to do

86
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,640
creditable, meaningful, impactful research. And so again, this was a real program. For two years,

87
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,960
I did nothing but study, nothing but take classes and study and learn. And then the latter two years

88
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
I spent in the research laboratory doing basically physical chemistry and protein

89
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
chemistry research of cell membranes. And Franny was supportive of this.

90
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,000
He was to an extent. To take that time off after internship required a few meetings. And I

91
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,840
ultimately, I remember sending him a note saying, look, I'm 23 years old. I've just finished the

92
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,880
residency. I need to do what I'm excited about. And he gave in and I have enormous respect for him

93
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,240
for that. And he was quite patient because I came back for a year and then I went down to the NIH to

94
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,720
was part of the Vietnam draft obligation. And he kept taking me back each time, which is very,

95
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,560
very nice. But turns out I set some kind of record at the Brigham. It took me 11 years from the time

96
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,600
that I started my internship to the time I actually finished the residency, which was some sort of

97
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,640
record at the record at the time. So you would have been a hold for a chief resident at that time.

98
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I guess. Yes, I was what? I was 33, 34 by the time I had my first job.

99
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,280
But of course you made up for it because you sort of progressed so early at the outset.

100
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,840
As you know well, the book that you wrote with John Barry in 1992, The Transformed Cell, is a book.

101
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,240
I may have the record for most times reading it. I may also possess the record for most copies

102
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
owned, which I know you get a kick out of that. Every time I say something to that effect,

103
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
you basically say I'm one of the few people who's read it, which I know is not true.

104
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,880
But I still remember the first time I read it. And it's a remarkable story. I suspect many people

105
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
will go on to read it after this interview because it is in many ways one of the best books about

106
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,200
science, which I think was your motivation for writing it. And we'll come back to that. But in

107
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,880
it you talk about an important moment in your training, which occurred in 1968 with a patient

108
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,920
who you met in the ER one day. Can you tell us a little bit about that story and why it

109
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,320
altered the course of your career? Well, there were actually two patients that I saw early on,

110
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:11,600
or was familiar with early on, that influenced my thinking about cancer. The first was a patient I

111
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,440
saw when I was a junior resident at the West Roxbury VA Hospital. We rotated through there

112
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,280
three or four months at a time during the residency. And it was a 68-year-old fellow who

113
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,480
came in complaining of right up a quadrant pain. It looked like a typical gallbladder attack, and

114
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,320
I got pretty excited about it because it might be a patient that I might be able to perform one of

115
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:43,520
the first operations I was allowed to do. And so I looked into his chart, and a remarkable story

116
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:51,040
was encountered. I looked into the chart, and it turned out that 11 or 12 years earlier,

117
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,000
that patient had been seen at the West Roxbury VA Hospital. He had had a gastric cancer,

118
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,160
a stomach cancer. He had undergone a laparotomy, and I looked at the surgeon's note, saying that

119
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,800
he opened the belly. He saw a tumor that was encompassing about three-quarters of the stomach.

120
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,080
There were multiple liver metastases, deposits that were biopsied, shown to be the gastric cancer

121
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,440
that had spread, multiple enlarged, hardened nodes. And he took out part of the stomach,

122
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,160
I guess, as a palliative measure, left the rest of the disease in place, and the patient recovered,

123
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,640
and about a week later went home. Well, as I turned the page of the chart, the patient comes

124
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,640
back three months later. Nobody had expected to see him. And he was doing fine. He was gaining

125
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,120
weight. Six months later, he was back working. And here he was 12 years later, having lived the

126
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,240
past 10 or 11 years completely normally. And so I took part in removing his gallbladder under

127
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,640
supervision, of course. And his belly was completely clean of cancer. There was no evidence of cancer

128
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,080
of any kind. And we went back and looked at his, be sure it was the same patient, re-reviewed the

129
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,440
pathology. Sure enough, it was a cancer that had spontaneously disappeared over time in the absence

130
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,480
of any therapy. One of the rarest events in medicine, and that is to have the spontaneous

131
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:27,520
regression of cancer without any treatments being given. Somehow, his body had rejected the cancer.

132
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,040
And I then did what turned out, of course, to be a very naive experiment. But I was wondering

133
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,320
whether or not this patient who had somehow cured his own cancer could be somehow taken advantage of

134
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
to treat other patients. And it turned out we had another patient in the hospital with a gastric

135
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,560
cancer, a veteran, who happened to have the same blood type. And so I called up the head of the

136
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,520
surgery department, Brownie Wheeler, and said, hey, I want to take a blood transfusion from this

137
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,760
patient who spontaneously was cured and give it to this other patient. And he said, okay, that was

138
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,280
the IRB as existed at that time. And so we actually got blood from this one patient and infused it into

139
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,160
the other veteran. But of course, it didn't do anything. And the other patient ended up dying of

140
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,160
his gastric cancer. But at least planted the seed that, in fact, maybe there was something

141
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,400
in the immune system that caused the rejection of that cancer, much as you would a foreign transplant.

142
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:37,120
And the body's major defense mechanism, of course, against foreign invaders is the immune system.

143
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,240
It got me thinking about potential immune manipulations. But there was a second patient

144
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,240
that also influenced me a great deal. And that was a patient that had been seen about a year before

145
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,680
I came to the Brigham as an intern. And this was a patient who had received one of the early kidney

146
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:03,520
transplants that were developed and innovated at the Brigham Hospital. He had received a kidney

147
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,720
from a young individual who died in a motorcycle accident. And that kidney was transplanted into

148
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,280
the recipient. And the recipient developed widespread renal cell cancer. And it turned out,

149
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,400
after study, that the kidney that had been transplanted inadvertently had contained a renal

150
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,440
cancer. That then, in this other patient, under the influence of immunosuppressive medications,

151
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:37,280
had spread widely through his body. So in an attempt to control this, the immunosuppressive

152
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,160
medications were stopped. Of course, the kidney rejected and had to be removed.

153
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,720
But the patient's cancer then went away as well, because it, too, was allogeneic. It, too, came from

154
00:16:51,520 --> 00:17:03,120
the genome of the original donor. So what did that teach one? Well, it showed that a large,

155
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:11,840
invasive, vascularized cancer could be caused to reject completely by the immune system. If you

156
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:19,920
had a strong enough stimulus, that could mediate that rejection. And so it was that spontaneous

157
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,200
regression. Maybe this demonstration that the immune system, more directly by removing

158
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:34,240
immunosuppressive medications, could result in tumor collapse and regression that tended to

159
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,960
put me on the path towards cancer. But I was already pretty much there because of what I had

160
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,880
seen as a doctor in cancer patients. Now, in the late 1960s, what was understood about the

161
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,560
human immune system as it pertained to even viruses, let alone cancer? I mean,

162
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,760
had MHC class one and class two been identified yet? I don't think they were identified until the

163
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:07,360
mid-70s, right? Class one in the 70s and the early 80s, class two. But when I started in 1974,

164
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,920
the idea of immunotherapy was a dream. There were anecdotes way back to the late 80s of

165
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,800
tumors going away when people got an infection, but really nothing stable. There was no ability

166
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,520
to measure an immune reaction against any cancer. There was no such thing as a cancer antigen that

167
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,160
had ever been found. There were no manipulations you could give that might work. So it was

168
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:43,360
a sort of a dark period when it came to knowledge about the immune system against cancer. It's a

169
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:52,240
little hard to understand just how frequent immunologic information developed. In the 1957

170
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,920
issue of the Journal of Immunology, the word lymphocyte was not in the index. We did not

171
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,120
understand what small lymphocytes did, what they were doing and circulating in the 1950s.

172
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,080
And so that information only came to pass in the early 60s when it was clear that

173
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,560
you could transfer immunity by transferring lymphocytes in a way that you could not do by

174
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,880
transferring blood or serum. And even in experimental animals, there was no manipulation

175
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,600
that could cause an existing cancer to disappear. You could immunize a mouse against a tumor by

176
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,760
letting it grow and then removing it and cause that mouse to resist an implantation of the same

177
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,800
tumor again. But once the tumor was growing, there was no maneuver that could keep it from

178
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,360
growing, no immunologic maneuver that could keep it from growing. So the field was desperately in

179
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:58,080
need of more information. So before we get to how you arrived at the NCI, well, actually let's talk

180
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,000
about that. It's a very unusual first job. How did it come about and what did you assume you would do

181
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,360
at the completion of this otherwise very long residency? So as you're indicating, I

182
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,720
finished my residency June 30th, 1974. And the next day I was appointed Chief of Surgery

183
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,840
at the National Cancer Institute, a position that I still hold. I'm still Chief of the Surgery

184
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:34,080
Branch now, what, 47 years later, 46 years later. The NIH, when I came here, I knew it was a

185
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:43,760
remarkable place. It had resources and a commitment, a mandate to make progress. It's a state-of-the-art

186
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:52,880
hospital that provides outstanding care to patients, but it exists again, not only to practice the best

187
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,640
of today's medicine, but to create the medicine of tomorrow. And that always intrigued me from my

188
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,400
first knowledge of the NIH when I came here in the midst of the residency during the Vietnam War.

189
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,960
Now you did have an offer to stay at Harvard, correct? Was Dana Farber still, was it in

190
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,560
existence at the time? Dana Farber was just being built, the hospital that was just being built.

191
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,400
Franny Moore, who was Chief of Surgery, offered me a position as the head of surgery in that new Dana

192
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:33,120
Farber institution. Emil Fry was the director of it and head of medical oncology, and he too offered

193
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,120
me the position. And I attentively accepted it, although we're in the midst of some negotiations

194
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
about whether there would be individual and independent operating rooms in the hospital

195
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,640
and so on. But in the course of that, I heard from one of the division directors here at the NIH,

196
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,600
who I had gotten to know when I was a fellow, who came to the Brigham to interview me.

197
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,800
He was wondering whether I would be interested in the position. And so he interviewed me, and

198
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,680
I was expecting to stay at the Brigham at Harvard, but one day I got a phone call from him saying

199
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,680
that the Chief of Surgery offered Ketchum was, had decided to retire, and the position was open July 1.

200
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,920
Was I interested? And I knew I was, but I had a call. My wife, Alice, told her about it. She said,

201
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:33,680
just pack, let's go, and off we went. Was Franny disappointed? Oh, it was a, it was a really shocking

202
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,960
encounter that I had with him, and that I went in to tell him I decided to go to the NIH. I thought

203
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,040
it was a place where I could best utilize my interests and knowledge, and he said no.

204
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,880
And I said, look, I've decided to do it. He said, you have to stay here. It's too great an opportunity

205
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,480
to turn down. And I said no, and he wasn't an easy guy to say no to, but I knew I wanted to

206
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,160
come back to the, to the NIH. And finally, after almost an hour, I finally said, Dr. Moore, I'm

207
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,320
not, I'm going down to Bethesda, Maryland. And I offered my hand, my hand to shake his hand

208
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,560
as I was going to leave, and he refused to shake my hand, which was a little shocking. But he got

209
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,200
over it finally. I left, and we became good friends, and he said all kinds of nice things about me when

210
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,440
he needed to. So it worked out well. You see, at that point, I knew I wanted to study cancer. I had

211
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,160
already made that absolute, absolute commitment, and the National Cancer Institute seemed like the

212
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:47,280
right way to, to do it. And in some sense, it was a logical decision from me, given my childhood

213
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,960
experience that got me interested in medicine and science. Cancer is such a devastating disease. It

214
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,800
attacks innocent people through no fault of their own. It makes them and their families watch

215
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:09,600
impotently as they progress and then die of cancer as a holocaust. And just seemed like the

216
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,000
kind of thing I wanted to study. So it was around this time, I guess, a little bit before this time

217
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,200
that Richard Nixon and that administration had declared a war on cancer. I believe it was just

218
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,680
a year prior to that. How did that resonate with you? Did you view that with great optimism?

219
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,080
Or did you think that it was naive that, you know, in a matter of years, cancer would be eradicated

220
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:41,440
in the same way that man had gone to the moon? Well, I had great hopes for making, for making

221
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,080
progress, perhaps naively, even at that point, not fully understanding all of the complexities.

222
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,960
The National Cancer Act mainly influenced funding outside of the NIH. The NIH was already, I thought,

223
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,600
well funded. Had a building that had been built in 1953, one of the largest buildings in this area,

224
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,360
dedicated to doing research. It had hospital beds. And so that National Cancer Act didn't have much

225
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,920
impact on the intramural NIH that I could see. But again, remember, I'm a worker bee. I became chief

226
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,840
of the surgery branch and have never advanced in the hierarchy. I was where I wanted to be. Turn

227
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,280
down a fair number of physicians. And so when it came to the influence of the National Cancer Act

228
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,600
on the country as a whole, I really wasn't involved with that very much at all. I focused

229
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,240
on the work that I wanted to do intramurally at the NIH. So how did you lay out a research agenda

230
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,600
when you arrived in 1974? You're now finally able to, not only with the resources of money,

231
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,800
but perhaps more importantly with the resources of time, lay out an agenda for hypotheses that

232
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:08,800
you want to test to build effectively a program to systematically narrow down the set of questions.

233
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,320
So what was the process by which you went about doing that? So when I came to the NIH,

234
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,520
knowing I wanted to study cancer, I started reading everything I possibly could about

235
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,520
therapeutic approaches, which at that point were simply surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy,

236
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:35,760
most used alone. And it was clear to me at that point that although incremental advances had been

237
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:45,120
made over the years, surgery 3,000 years old, radiation therapy began immediately after

238
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:55,920
Renkin discovered x-rays in 1895, and chemotherapy arose in biological and chemical warfare

239
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:07,280
laboratories here at Fort Detrick in Dietrich, Maryland to attempt to develop these agents.

240
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:16,480
And it was in laboratory accidents in 1942 when nitrogen mustard was inadvertently exposed to

241
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,320
laboratory technicians and found to develop a lymphopenia throughout their body with their

242
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,840
lymph nodes shrinking down that led a Yale physician to attempt to use nitrogen mustard,

243
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,040
now known as melphalan, as a chemotherapy agent. And that was the birth of chemotherapy

244
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,880
in 1942, and that started chemicals to treat, search for chemicals to treat cancer.

245
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,720
But the advances that were being made were slowly and tiny incremental. I wanted something that big

246
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,560
that would make a big difference. And as I began to read about the immune system,

247
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,480
how little was known about it, but with the examples that I had, the intuition that I had

248
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,480
developed, which is so important in science, that this might be something valuable that I decided

249
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:13,120
to study immunology. I looked at everything I could read about, and it seemed to me that

250
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,440
the immune cells that were then being recognized as the mediators of organ rejection were the

251
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:29,280
agents that one needed to stimulate. And why not use an immune cell as a drug that has taken

252
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,160
advantage of a patient's own immune reactions to try to treat the disease, immunotherapy. And I

253
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,200
started with some unbelievably naive experiments. There was no way at that point to keep lymphocytes

254
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,800
alive outside the body. We're talking about 1974. You could take them out, and they would die in a

255
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,440
day or two. And you had no way to keep them alive. You could mix them with other cells,

256
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
and they would stimulate for a few days, but then they would die after about a week.

257
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,920
And yet I was desperate to try to use lymphocytes with immune reactivity to treat patients.

258
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,320
And so I began implanting human tumors into the mesentery of mini pigs. A good friend of mine,

259
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,840
David Sacks, here had developed a mini pig colony that was partially inbred at MHC Losai.

260
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,920
And so I would embed a tumor in the mesentery of these mini pigs, wait about two weeks, operate

261
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,840
and remove the inflamed lymph nodes that were draining that tumor, and gave those lymphocytes

262
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,680
to six patients. That is, we take out their tumor, generate lymphocytes,

263
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,440
react them against that tissue, and then harvest lymphocytes from that pig and administer them

264
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,680
intravenously to patients. And of course, nothing happened. But it's just a sign of how desperate I

265
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,560
was at that point to have some impact to be doing something. I have over the door of my lab,

266
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:09,840
you probably remember it, when you were in the lab, it said, it's a modification of a Louis Pasteur

267
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,120
saying that said, chance favors the prepared mind. And what I added to it was,

268
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,320
chance favors the prepared mind only if the mind is at work. And so I was trying things. And it was

269
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:32,640
only with the discovery of T cell growth factor in 1976 by Morgan, Rossetti and Gallo that opened

270
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,320
the door to be able to manipulate lymphocytes outside the body by putting them in a growth

271
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,120
factor called interleukin-2. And that was something I began to study quite intensively

272
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,600
to see if one couldn't then grow lymphocytes that had anti-tumor activity and would retain it as they

273
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,800
grew. None of that was known, but those were the first experiments I was doing along those lines.

274
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Now, before we go further, I think it's worth making sure people understand some of the

275
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,680
semantics because obviously you and I can take so much of this for granted. But

276
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,480
let's start with some basics about cancer. How does one define cancer? What separates

277
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,720
a cancer cell from a non-cancer cell? Well, if you look at the broadest properties,

278
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,040
there are two properties that separate cancer from other cells in the body. The first is

279
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,800
uncontrolled growth. Virtually all of the tissues we have, either fingernails or eyebrows or you

280
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,600
name it, they'll grow to a given amount and then they'll stop. Well, cancers don't have that

281
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,800
signal to stop. They'll keep growing. And the second is it's the only cell that can arise in

282
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:52,400
one part of the body and spread and live and divide and grow in another part of the body.

283
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,200
And that's not true of virtually any other kind of cell. So cells with uncontrolled growth

284
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,040
that can spread and grow elsewhere are the biologic properties. Now, we can dig down layer

285
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:11,840
by layer by layer and get to the point of, well, why does a normal cell ultimately become a cancer

286
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,560
cell? And we now understand that that's due to the accumulation of mutations in DNA of these cells

287
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:26,000
divide, which explains why it's the common organs of the body, all of which have ducts. The lining

288
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,200
of those ducts are constantly turning over. And as that DNA is turning over, mistakes are made

289
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
called mutations. And it's that accumulation of mutations that results in the cancer itself. So

290
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,880
we can take it all the way from the biology of uncontrolled growth, but down to the very

291
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,600
molecules that are involved. We can describe it. It doesn't mean we really understand it all,

292
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,000
but we can describe it. And let's also explain to people the difference between the epithelial

293
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,320
tumors, the hematologic tumors, and even let's frame it as it was in 1974 in terms of what was

294
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,920
a person's odds of surviving. So maybe tell folks what the common epithelial tumors are and explain

295
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,280
a little bit about the, we're not going to go into staging in great detail, but what's the difference

296
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,960
between local tumor versus metastatic tumor and what's the impact that has on a person's survival

297
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,120
at the time you arrived at NCI? So the hematologic cancers, of course, are the blood cancers and they

298
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,640
start from progenitors in the hematopoietic system, because after all, the hematopoietic system starts

299
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,600
from an individual stem cell that then divides into multiple different characteristics, much as

300
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:49,840
we all grow from a single fertilized egg from one cell that makes us what we are.

301
00:33:51,520 --> 00:34:01,440
So even back then, and a little more so now, if you developed a cancer of the bloodstream,

302
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,720
which were about 10% of all cancer deaths are due to those, 90% of cancer deaths are due to

303
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,000
the epithelial cancer. So these start in the solid organs of the body, and that goes all the way from

304
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,560
the rectum up through the GI tract, through the stomach, through the esophagus, the pancreas,

305
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,880
the GU organs, the testis, the ovary, the prostate. All of these solid organs have ducts,

306
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,920
and as I've mentioned, it's the epithelial lining of the ducts that are turning over that

307
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:40,800
become the cancer. In blood cancers, it's the more primordial cells that develop into neutrophils and

308
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,360
lymphocytes and other types of cells. So let's talk about the solid tumors, which are 90% of all

309
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,360
cancer deaths. Last year in the United States, there were about 600,000 deaths due to cancer,

310
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:04,960
550,000 were due to the solid epithelial cancers. If you operate on a patient who develops a cancer

311
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,040
to remove that cancer, then well over half the time that patient will be cured. That is, go on

312
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,000
and live their normal lifespan. But the half, a little less than half of patients that cannot

313
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,120
be cured result in this enormous tragedy of 600,000 innocent people dying of cancer every year.

314
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,680
Once the cancer spreads, however, and this in my view is a dirty little secret of oncology,

315
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:41,680
and that is that if a cancer spreads from its local site and cannot be surgically removed,

316
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,800
then the death rate in that patient is 100%. That is, we have virtually no

317
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,680
treatments that can cure, systemic treatments that can cure a patient with a metastatic solid

318
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,320
cancer that is one that has spread to a different site that can't be surgically resected. Now,

319
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,000
there are a couple of exceptions to that. There are two solid tumor exceptions that have existed

320
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,840
for several decades. One is choriocarcinoma. These are cancers that start in the placenta of pregnant

321
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,840
women that then spread, and you can have 90% of the lung replaced by that tumor, receive methotrexate,

322
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,640
a chemotherapy drug, and it will all disappear. Still don't understand exactly how. Germ cell

323
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:36,320
tumors in the male, tumors of the testis like Lance Armstrong, who had brain mets and lung mets,

324
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,800
no matter how much they've spread, if you give patients platinum-derived chemotherapy

325
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,000
regimens, you can cause complete, durable regression of that metastatic disease.

326
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,640
Up until 1985, those were the only cancers that could be cured. We can now add to that list,

327
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,160
solid cancers. We can now add to that list melanoma and renal cancer because Interleukin-2

328
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,360
administered the patients back in the mid-80s cause complete regressions of widely metastatic

329
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,480
cancer in patients that are still alive today. But that's it. Choriocarcinoma,

330
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,880
germ cell tumors, melanoma, renal cancer, other than those for everyone who develops

331
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,440
a spread cancer will die of it despite all the best treatments that we have. We read in the paper

332
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,080
that this celebrity has cancer and they're going to fight it and they're going to beat it, but

333
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,080
nobody beats it. We're in such desperate need of better treatments for patients with metastatic

334
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,360
cancers because we just, we can beat them back a little bit. We can improve survival by months

335
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,440
and for some cancers, maybe a few years like breast cancer and colon cancer, but everybody

336
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,840
ultimately will succumb to the disease. Well, and that's what I was actually going to ask you about,

337
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,240
which is if you think about the past 50 years in cancer and what you just said, I really,

338
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,240
I still starkly remember having those discussions as a medical student with you.

339
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:09,840
And the main point was we've basically just extended median survival of metastatic cancer,

340
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,680
but we haven't increased overall survival. And what would be the extent to which even median

341
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,240
survival has changed if we are just talking about stage four of the common cancers, breast,

342
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,800
colorectal, lung, pancreatic? How much has the needle been moved with respect to median

343
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,520
survival, notwithstanding the fact that overall survival hasn't changed?

344
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,600
Well, if you look at current papers and advertisements, most regimens that

345
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,840
ultimately get approved by the Food and Drug Administration prolong survival by

346
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,800
months. Probably the best example in modern oncology is treatment of metastatic colorectal

347
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,600
cancer. When I started median survival would have been maybe eight to 10 months. Now it's

348
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,400
two and a half years. So there's an example where life has been extended by years. Breast

349
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,040
cancer patients can go from one regimen to another, each one causing some temporary

350
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,680
regression of the cancer or limitation of its growth, but the cancer will ultimately grow and

351
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,560
the patient will have to move on to something else. And that's why cancer care is so remarkably

352
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,760
expensive because people just move from one treatment that can prolong life by a few weeks,

353
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,040
like a lot live in pancreatic cancer, six week improvement in survival. For $40,000, right?

354
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:49,280
For enormous toxicity and huge, huge life altering expense. The most frequently prescribed drug in

355
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,400
oncology today is a vastin, Bevacizumab, which can impact on blood vessels and tumors.

356
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,160
And the trials of that regimen in combination with others will prolong survival in patients

357
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,720
with colorectal cancer by about four and a half months. But those are the tiny increments,

358
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,720
which can provide substantial, some can provide substantial benefit to patients, but

359
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,280
not a curative and people are always living under the cloud of that cancer that is going to,

360
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:32,720
is going to regrow. So we need something more dramatic than the application of surgery,

361
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,840
radiation and chemotherapy barring some enormous advances in those fields.

362
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,920
And I think one other point worth making for folks with respect to chemotherapy,

363
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
I was actually just on the phone yesterday with one of my patients whose

364
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:55,760
wife is currently recovering from surgery, from a cancer. And he asked a question about the

365
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,560
efficacy of chemotherapy and how good is chemotherapy at killing cancer cells,

366
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,760
which I thought was an interesting question. And it led to a discussion where I said,

367
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,040
you know, the challenge with chemotherapy is not finding chemotherapeutic agents that can kill

368
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,720
cancer cells. You know, I made a point that he probably had 20 chemicals in his home and in his

369
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,040
garage that could kill every cancer cell remaining in his wife. The issue is how can you do that

370
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,280
selectively? How could you do that and not at the same time kill the normal cells? And I think

371
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,160
therein lies the arbitrage that needs to be exploited with chemotherapy and ultimately

372
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,720
what we're going to talk about, which is immunotherapy. But I think that's an important

373
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,600
point that many people don't understand, which is how difficult it is to thread the needle of

374
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,320
chemotherapy. It's not the killing of cancer that's hard. It's the killing of cancer and not

375
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:56,160
killing the non-cancer. No, the point you make is incredibly important because it's the selective

376
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,640
killing of cancer without killing normal cells, which is not the case for virtually any chemotherapy

377
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,560
or radiation therapy. Even in surgery, you have to remove some normal tissue. And so it's that

378
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,320
selectivity against the cancer that's so important. And in fact, that's almost the perfect

379
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,800
explanation for another reason that I think immunotherapy has potential importance because

380
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,880
of its immense selectivity and sensitivity of recognition. Can recognize single amino acid

381
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,200
changes in a protein and develop an immune response against it. Trivial differences that

382
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,480
can distinguish normal from tumor or if you get a viral infection, destroy the virus

383
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,840
in the respiratory system without destroying the respiratory epithelium. It's the exquisite

384
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,800
sensitivity and specificity of the immune reaction that I think makes it such a seductively

385
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,120
interesting approach to trying to develop new cancer treatments. Well, let's take a moment and

386
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,200
have people get a little bit deeper on how the immune system works. I remember for me personally

387
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,200
in medical school, it was one of the most interesting sets of courses we took where the

388
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:23,280
courses in immunology, in particular how T cells worked was fascinating. It seemed to lend itself

389
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:31,200
to a story almost and with generals and soldiers and all of these things. So explain to people,

390
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,560
let's maybe start with a virus as the example because obviously in the era of coronavirus,

391
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,720
that's on everybody's mind and we can talk about how the body defeats a virus, but then pivot to

392
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,040
then how in the case of cancer, that exact same immune system can accomplish what you just said.

393
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,960
So let's take viral infection as an example, whether it's a common cold or coronavirus.

394
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,240
The virus comes into the body and infects the respiratory epithelium in the

395
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:12,000
pharynx and the bronchi and the lung. And as that virus then infects those respiratory epithelium,

396
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,240
the virus replicates and the infected cells then express the viral proteins.

397
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,800
The immune system has evolved to detect proteins or other molecules that are not part of the normal

398
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:35,360
self of the body. As the immune system evolves, cells that can recognize foreign invaders get

399
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,760
spared, whereas cells that can attack normal tissue get eliminated in the thymus. And so

400
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,160
except for autoimmune diseases, we don't have cells that can recognize normal tissues. They've

401
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:55,440
been eliminated in the evolution of our immune systems. So you have lymphocytes, B cells that

402
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:04,560
make antibodies, T cells that act directly by interacting with other tissues. And so

403
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,920
the immune system via antibodies or T cells recognizes viral protein that's now being expressed

404
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,000
by the respiratory cell. The lymphocytes are constantly patrolling the body. Every 14 or 15

405
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,640
seconds, your heart's pumping out these lymphocytes that are circulating through the vascular system,

406
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,520
sometimes extravasating into tissues, coming back into the lymphoid system and returning to the

407
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:37,200
heart via the thoracic duct. Well, when the lymphocyte encounters a foreign antigen to which

408
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,560
it can have reactivity that's not cells. And define an antigen for folks to tell people what an

409
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,360
antigen is. How long is it? What's it made of? So an antigen is a molecule in the body that is not

410
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:56,080
normally being expressed in the body by tissues. They're generally proteins, but they can be

411
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,600
carbohydrates. And what makes that molecule an antigen is its ability to be recognized by a

412
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,920
T lymphocyte or a B lymphocyte. That is a T lymphocyte that can directly recognize an infected cell

413
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,640
or a B lymphocyte that can make antibodies against it plasma cells. And so if a molecule is recognized

414
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,760
as foreign, the immune system can recognize that antigen. Well, lymphocytes are patrolling the body.

415
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,320
Lymphocytes are patrolling the body. They encounter this viral antigen in the respiratory

416
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,280
epithelium. They stop at that location and you can visualize this in mouth ears with something

417
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,960
called two-photon microscopy. They stop at that location and you can see them extravasate

418
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,920
into the tissue. When they're there, they then begin to divide. As they divide, the dividing

419
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,680
cells can further recognize the viral protein and starts making molecules that can destroy

420
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,160
the infected cells, but also call other cells into that arena, macrophages, neutrophils, and so on.

421
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,560
And that's what an immune reaction is. As the antigen is eliminated by these mechanisms,

422
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,520
lymphocytes, other cells, there's no reason for those cells to stay around anymore. They're not

423
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,160
stimulated. They enter the circulation, but now you have patrolling the body for the rest of your

424
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,800
life. Long live lymphocytes that can recognize those foreign molecules. And that's why when you

425
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,400
get immunized against smallpox, you have that immunization for the rest of your life and

426
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,800
hopefully for coronavirus, although we don't know that. We don't know the extent to which those cells

427
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:38,000
survive. Now, at the outset, you said there are two things about cancer that make it different

428
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,680
from self. It has these two properties that individually wouldn't be the end of the world,

429
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,720
but when you combine them, they're devastating. It's this failure to respond to cell cycle

430
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:56,080
signaling, which results in unregulated growth. And it's this capacity to leave the site of origin

431
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:03,040
and grow in an unregulated manner elsewhere. And you also mentioned that this is the result of,

432
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,720
although you didn't use the word, somatic mutations, which we can clarify for people,

433
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,120
these aren't typically mutations that people are born with, although in diseases like Lynch

434
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,800
syndrome, that might be the case that it leads to that. But these are acquired mutations.

435
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,480
So the natural question would be, why is it that a cell that has these acquired mutations that

436
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,440
clearly produce a phenotype that is different from self, why wouldn't that be foreign enough

437
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,800
for the immune system to act? In other words, why does cancer even exist in the first place?

438
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Why doesn't it get squashed out in its infancy? So these mutations, these changes in DNA that

439
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:59,520
are random events as the cell is dividing can produce proteins that can be recognized or other

440
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,640
molecules recognized by the immune system. And they do it in complex ways by breaking down

441
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,680
small molecule peptides and putting it on the cell surface. But the immune system can recognize

442
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:21,120
these mutations. And it's only been in the last, I'd say, three or four years that we now recognize

443
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:30,400
these mutations as commonly recognized by the immune system. And about 80% of patients with

444
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,240
the common epithelial cancers, it turns out as a result of the research done in recent years,

445
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,280
do exist. It can recognize the products of the mutations. But the immune system against them

446
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,080
is too small, is not vigorous enough. What does that mean? Create enough cells, create receptors

447
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:58,560
that have a high enough validity for recognition to the tumor. The immune reaction is not very

448
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,640
strong. And the growth of the tumor can overcome the small impact that an immune reaction might

449
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:13,440
have in killing some tumor cells. Plus for a tumor cell to survive and grow, it develops certain

450
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:21,600
properties that can suppress the local immune reaction. It can make molecules like transforming

451
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:28,560
growth factor beta, TGF beta. It can make cytokines like interleukin 10. It can cause the

452
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:36,160
development of cells lymphocytes that inhibit immune reactions. I mean virtually every

453
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,960
physiologic system in the body has stimulatory elements and inhibitory elements. You have

454
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,320
hormones that can increase gastric secretion, some that can decrease it. You have a sympathetic

455
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,120
nervous system, a parasympathetic nervous system. Well the immune system is the same.

456
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,840
It has effector cells that can be very aggressive and recognize antigens. And it has regulatory T

457
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,680
cells that deliberately suppress immune reactions. And that's one of the things that keeps us from

458
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,640
developing autoimmune disease. But there are many of these regulatory elements. Recently described

459
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:19,200
myeloid derived suppressor cells can suppress immune reactions. And so it's the balance of the

460
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,760
aggressive immune reaction against the inhibitory molecules that can prevent that immune reaction

461
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:34,400
that is the holy grail of trying to find effective treatments. And effective treatments

462
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,520
come in both directions. Interleukin 2 stimulates immune reactions. And we now have checkpoint

463
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:52,160
modulators like Ipilumimab or PD-1 inhibitors that can inhibit these inhibitory factors and

464
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,160
thereby stimulate the immune reaction by taking away the breaks on the immune system. So the more

465
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,520
we understand the more we can take advantage of the biology. So let's go back to the first of those

466
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:10,000
because that seems to have been the first big break you got at NCI after Gallo's discovery

467
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:19,440
was Interleukin 2. So now you had both a cytokine that could allow you to grow lymphocytes

468
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,200
in vitro but also something that could be given to patients in vivo to stimulate the immune system.

469
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,400
So how did that sort of propel your work? Well with the advent of Interleukin 2,

470
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,440
what had been shown was that there were some bone marrow cells could make a substance which

471
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,000
would keep lymphocytes alive outside the body. But the minute I heard about that,

472
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,600
there were a series of questions that arose. Well if it kept lymphocytes alive,

473
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,720
would it keep lymphocytes alive and dividing in a format that enabled them to have all of their

474
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:04,480
immune recognition? That is as they grew would they just lose that property? And so we try to

475
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:11,840
demonstrate that by developing cells that could recognize what we call alloantigens that is very

476
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,520
strong antigens that are present in one person that inhibit the ability to transplant organs

477
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,400
for example. And so our initial studies were to see whether or not we could develop

478
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:30,960
lymphocytes, grow them in culture, and cause experimental skin grafts in mice to disappear

479
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,200
faster. We're not talking about tumor, that's normal tissue. And we showed that in fact we

480
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,320
could grow lymphocytes that retain their function in the laboratory and then retain their function

481
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:48,400
in vivo. Well with that knowledge, we didn't want to cause skin grafts to disappear more quickly.

482
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,880
With that knowledge, we had to try to develop cells that could react against the cancer.

483
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,920
And very early on when we grew cells in interleukin-2, we found that in fact they could destroy

484
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,680
tissue-cultured cancer cells, have some impact on normal cultured cells as well,

485
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,400
just by virtue of exposure to interleukin-2. And we call them lac cells, lymphoclin-activated killer

486
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,360
cells. And we studied them for three or four years. It turned out to be a false alarm because

487
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:23,040
they could impact on tiny little tumors in mice before they became vascularized, but by the time

488
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:31,520
they were vascularized they would not work in mice at all. But interleukin-2 seemed like a molecule

489
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,720
that might be able to stimulate those rare cells in the body that could recognize the cancer as

490
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,000
foreign, or develop cells in the laboratory that could do that recognition. And that then led us

491
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
to many years of experiments in the laboratory, but also clinical trials trying to see whether

492
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,080
or not either interleukin-2 administration alone or cells that you could devise in vitro that could

493
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:04,720
recognize a tumor and administer those. And that was a very frustrating time. It wasn't until 1984

494
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:13,360
that we finally figured out a way to use interleukin-2 to mediate regression. We treated

495
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:20,800
over 70 patients with either interleukin-2 or cells that we grew and interleukin-2 and administered

496
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:28,880
to patients without seeing a response until we modified the schedule of interleukin-2 administration,

497
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,320
knowing it's pharmacokinetics that is only after half-life inside the body of about seven minutes.

498
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,480
And so we had to alter the schedule. We had to give higher and higher doses, which mediated

499
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,320
toxicity, until finally a patient that we treated in 1984, we had widespread melanoma,

500
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,880
was administered interleukin-2, and was the first patient finally after over 70 other patients to

501
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:03,600
show us a tumor regression, the first time that a deliberate immunologic maneuver could reproducibly

502
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,560
cause cancer regression. It was one of the few eureka moments that I've had in doing research,

503
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,920
but the realization finally that after all of those patient deaths,

504
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,040
everybody had advanced cancer, all would go on the die of their cancer,

505
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,600
survived, and that patient now alive over 35 years later, free of disease.

506
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:34,320
You know, it reminds me a lot of Thomas Starzell's work in the 1960s with liver

507
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,840
transplantation, where the number of patients who died was, it was hard to keep track of

508
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,360
before finally achieving the technical success that was necessary, both the perioperative

509
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,800
care and the post-operative care and the technical skill necessary, plus the immunosuppressive

510
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,440
regimen. All of those four things had to be firing on all cylinders for patients to finally

511
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:09,040
undergo liver transplantation. And this patient in 1984, if I recall, was the 67th patient treated,

512
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:17,440
meaning 67 consecutive patients died of metastatic cancer and were unresponsive to interleukin-2.

513
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,720
The first question is really just a logistics question. How many different histologies were

514
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,640
in that group? How many different types of cancers were you treating at that time?

515
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,120
We were treating all cancers, metastatic cancers, with the idea that although they each arose from

516
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,520
different organs, had somewhat different properties and methods of spread, there would be commonalities

517
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,120
that could be attacked. And so we were treating all kinds of histologies. It was

518
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:54,720
the first patient that we treated with this revised regimen happened to have a melanoma.

519
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,520
The third and fourth patients had renal cancer. And as we continued to use interleukin-2, we found

520
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,520
that those two histologies, patients with those two histologic types of cancer, could respond and

521
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,680
ultimately response rates in those two diseases turned out to be about 15 to 20 percent of patients

522
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,080
with about a third of those patients having complete durable regressions.

523
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,080
But it was a little different than the liver transplant situation. Because in that situation,

524
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,360
there were technical problems that had to be overcome. And it was a genius of Tom Starville

525
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,520
to stick with it and to figure out those technical problems. When it came to immunotherapy for cancer,

526
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,680
it was a little different. We didn't know that it would ever work. We didn't know that there

527
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,440
was ever going to be an immune system that could cause a cancer to disappear.

528
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,600
In contrast to if you could work the technical problems out of so the vessels together,

529
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,840
you could get this thing to work. And so that first patient had an enormous impact on me and

530
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:05,680
on the field because it showed that it was possible. And until you know it's possible,

531
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:12,560
you never know that it's ever going to occur. And so that changed everything because it showed

532
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:18,960
that simply administering this one molecule, a T cell growth factor, could cause a cancer

533
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,880
regression in a patient. And that then led us to studies to understand how that was occurring.

534
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,720
And that then led to a lot of different directions, cell transfer, gene modification, and so on.

535
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:40,320
How did you keep going in the face of all of those failures up until this patient's

536
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:50,160
miraculous remission in 1984? How did you, because again, let's, if you were working as a surgical

537
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,880
oncologist at the time, you would not have been exposed to that death. The surgical oncologist's

538
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,760
work would have been done after the primary resection. Typically the medical oncologist

539
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,160
would be the one that would be at that patient's bedside as they progress through treatment. But

540
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,960
you were seeing something that you would not have seen had you chose a different arc to your

541
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:20,640
surgical career. And I just, I wonder how you coped with that. What were those drives home?

542
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,000
What were the drive, you know, what was it like to be alone in your thoughts?

543
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,760
Well, you know, as I look back on it, it seems remarkable that there were so many patients,

544
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,120
one after another, everyone died eventually of their cancer because we did not have any

545
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:44,080
impact in the manipulations that we were, that we're applying. And, you know, you're a doctor

546
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:48,560
and you know that it's not the patients that do well that you remember, it's the patients that you

547
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:57,600
you fail to help that you remember. And there was just a remarkable number of tragedies,

548
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,080
young people dying of cancer, people of all ages. But I had this intuition

549
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,160
based on everything I knew about biology and everything I had studied in biophysics. I had

550
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:19,120
an intuition and also influenced by these inklings of the first two patients I mentioned

551
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:25,520
that this would, this would work. You know, I recently saw a quote by Abraham Lincoln

552
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:37,280
that said success consists of moving from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

553
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,720
And that actually happened to me. I actually just saw that quote a few months ago. But

554
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:54,320
I always felt it was going to work. And it did eventually. And a small number of patients,

555
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:59,680
still a long way to go. But at least now we have effective immunotherapies for a variety of

556
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,960
diseases that can be effective. And when that first patient responded,

557
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,440
they, it all exploded in my brain. It does work. This can work. And we'll figure out now ways to

558
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:20,080
make it better. And I imagine Alice was a big part of that support for you. Again, I know I have the

559
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:25,040
privilege of knowing her and knowing how important she is. Do you think you could have got through

560
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:31,040
this alone without the support of your family? I mean, you had to do this very difficult thing,

561
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,840
which was basically, you know, have this remarkable obligation to your family,

562
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,640
which every father does. And at the same time, you felt like you were carrying the weight of

563
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,000
your world, the weight of the world on your shoulders, trying to take care of these patients

564
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,680
who were otherwise really left with no hope. Do you see that as sort of a synergy between those two?

565
01:02:53,680 --> 01:03:04,640
They were probably, and I'm not exaggerating, 40 days in the first 40 years of my work here,

566
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,800
that I was in town, not traveling, that I was not in this hospital.

567
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:18,080
I would come in every day, of course. I would come in every Saturday. Sundays, I would come in to go

568
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,640
over research with some of the fellows. You probably remember that or see some patients.

569
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:35,840
And that kind of life requires support of some kind. And there are not a lot of wives who I think

570
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:44,560
would tolerate that kind of commitment outside the home. And Alice was such a person.

571
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:52,080
She never hassled me about it, always understood that. I remember once she said,

572
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:57,040
look, I know what you're doing is important. And so what I'm going to do as much as I can

573
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:02,560
is relieve you of the burdens that we commonly face as part of daily living. She handles,

574
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:08,320
I haven't written a check in 20 years. Alice pays our bills and really takes care of so much that

575
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:15,760
enabled me to work at that level. But it was a family thing. I have three daughters who were

576
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,040
growing up as all of this was happening. And I remember when my oldest daughter applied,

577
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,520
my first daughter applied to college, Beth, she opened her college essay with it,

578
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:34,160
setting somewhat along the lines of, at our dinner table at home, we're much more likely to be

579
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:42,160
talking about cancer and AIDS than the Washington Redskins. And made me understand how much the

580
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:49,520
kids had been affected by all of this talk of death and suffering from these diseases. So

581
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,760
it takes a family. And I doubt I could have done it without that kind of support.

582
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:04,160
So once you identified this patient, patient number 67, did you have an inkling what it was

583
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:11,200
about melanoma and renal cell cancer that made them particularly immunogenic relative to

584
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,640
this whole host of other epithelial cancers that were less reactive?

585
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:25,200
The answer is no. But the answer would be yes, 35 years later. But I think now we do understand

586
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,360
what's different about melanoma. But we didn't at the time. We were seeing responses to interleukin

587
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,880
two in patients with melanoma and kidney cancer, but no other diseases would respond to interleukin

588
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,640
two. And we learned that the hard way, treating over 600 patients with interleukin two here at

589
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:50,880
the clinical center, it turns out those two diseases were uniquely responsive. And we now

590
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:58,240
know, at least for melanoma, why that's the case. And that is the immune system is recognizing the

591
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:06,080
products of mutations. And melanoma, if one looks at the number of the frequency of mutations among

592
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,480
different cancer types, melanoma has more mutations than any other cancer type with the exception of

593
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:20,480
lung cancer. They're about equivalent, about 400 mutations per tumor as a median. And that's very

594
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:28,480
likely because melanoma induced by a carcinogen, ultraviolet light, lung cancer by the carcinogens

595
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,760
largely in cigarette smoke or the environment, that leads to an increased number of mutations.

596
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,360
And that at least is part of the answer. And that is the more mutations you have in the cancer,

597
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:45,120
the more likelihood that you'll develop a particular protein, foreign protein, that can be recognized

598
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,640
by the immune system. Did you ever see patients with Lynch syndrome response? They would typically

599
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,480
have many mutations as well, wouldn't they? You're exactly right. So there are some situations like

600
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:03,920
the microsatellite unstable cancers, colon cancer, other kinds of cancer types, Lynch syndrome.

601
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,560
But we didn't understand that with mutations that were involved at that point, and I don't remember

602
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,120
ever treating a patient with Lynch syndrome. You're right. They would have a very large number of

603
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:24,640
mutations. So for comparison, if we talk about a standard, you can't even use the word standard

604
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,640
you can't even use the word standard. There's no such thing as a standard cancer. Right now,

605
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:34,080
we know so much about cancer that every cancer is different. But what would be the median number

606
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,040
of mutations in a metastatic breast cancer, colon cancer or pancreatic cancer?

607
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:51,280
You would probably encompass 80% of these common cancers. If you considered mutation frequency

608
01:07:51,280 --> 01:08:00,160
between 60 to 70 and 150, that would be the major the median would probably be somewhere

609
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:05,600
about 110. But it would vary from cancer type to a cancer type. Some pediatric cancers have

610
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:14,880
very few mutations. Some cancers have more. But about I'd say the median would very likely to be

611
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:22,160
about 110. How many of those mutations would be driver mutations? So they are oncogenes,

612
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,760
tumor suppressor genes. They are playing a functional role in the cancer versus what we

613
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:33,920
might call passenger mutations that can still produce antigens. They would still generate a

614
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,200
peptide that could be recognized by MHC, but they're not playing a functional role in those

615
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:46,720
two properties of cancer that we spoke about. So about six years ago, we described an assay

616
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:54,640
that would enable us to actually identify the exact molecular nature of these antigens that

617
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:02,320
are recognized by T cells. And that came from, again, the understanding that it was the products

618
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:11,920
of these unique cancer mutations that were being recognized by the immune system. Well,

619
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:18,960
it turns out that some of these antigens that are recognized by T cells are recognizing the

620
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,520
proteins that derive from driver mutations, that is, that caused the cancer in the first place,

621
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:31,600
like P53, present in half of all cancers. But only about 2% of patients develop immune reactions

622
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:37,360
against it. KRAS, about 90% of pancreatic cancers, will have that as a driver mutation.

623
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:44,000
But what's stunning to me about oncology and the biology of cancer, and that is how few

624
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:53,280
of these shared cancer mutations exist. There's P53, there's KRAS. To some extent, pick 3CA in

625
01:09:53,280 --> 01:10:02,320
breast cancer, maybe BRAF mutations in melanoma. Other than that, the incidence of driver mutations

626
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,640
as a cause of cancer is low single digits. You'd think there would be many mutations that would

627
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:15,520
change the cell so dramatically. But it turns out it's not only those few driver mutations,

628
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,560
but the accumulation of mutations, each with its own property, that in and of itself

629
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,280
appears unlikely to cause cancer. But in concert with the action of other genes,

630
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,920
other mutations does cause a cancer. And we've more recently shown in a breast cancer patient

631
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,440
that we published a few years ago that we could mediate complete durable regression,

632
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:43,440
now over six years later, by targeting for what appeared to be random somatic mutations,

633
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:50,400
none of which had a driver function. But in concert, cause the cancer and by attacking them,

634
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,640
you could cause cancers to disappear. Now, I mean, I still am struggling to understand why it is

635
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:05,920
that a P53 mutation or a KRAS mutation is not immunogenic. Is that simply due to the evolution

636
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,320
of cancer, that because of the ubiquity of these mutations in cancer, cancer has come up with

637
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:19,760
enough evolutionary tricks to evade detection of those mutations? I mean, that's a teleologic

638
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,800
question, but I mean, do we have any biologic insight into this?

639
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:34,880
So you have to get a, have to dig a little deeper into the biology. For a mutation gives rise to a

640
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:42,880
molecule, a protein, right? It's DNA, RNA transcribed, translated into a protein. For that protein,

641
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:49,120
even though it has now a mutation, a string of amino acids that are not seen as normal by the body,

642
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:56,800
that mutation, that abnormal amino acid called a non-synonymous mutation is only recognized by

643
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,800
the immune system. If the molecule in which it occurs is broken down inside the cell into small

644
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:12,800
peptides, that is small sequences of amino acids, or the tumor cell or the antigen presenting cell

645
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,800
takes an antigen, a protein from the outside of the cell into the cell and breaks it into small

646
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:25,600
peptides, strings of amino acids. Well, that has to happen. And then one of those strings of amino

647
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:34,000
acids has to fit onto the surface of the patient's own HLA molecule, that is the kind of molecules

648
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,040
that we call transplantation molecules. And so for a mutation to be recognized by the immune

649
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:47,520
system, it has to be broken into these 9 to 11 amino acid peptides and fit on that patient's own

650
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,400
transplantation molecule. And that transplantation molecule is highly polymorphic. There are hundreds

651
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:02,880
of them. And so if you had a mutation and your cells made small peptides, but it didn't fit on

652
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:09,920
your HLA molecule, it wouldn't be recognized by the immune system. And so as we've learned more

653
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:19,280
in the last 5 to 6 years about what cancer antigens are, it's these mutations that are broken down

654
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:27,440
and put on the surface of a patient's presenting cells or tumor cells. And that turns out to be

655
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:36,480
between 1.5 and 2% of all mutations. And when you look at melanoma, it's 1.3%. When you look at the

656
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:44,480
gastrointestinal cancers, 1.6%, breast cancer, 2.1% of mutations are immunogenic because they happen

657
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:52,400
to fit into that individual patient's HLA molecule. And the most stunning finding of recent years,

658
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:04,480
in my view, in this field is that virtually every patient recognizes a unique antigen. And so we're

659
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:12,480
in the process of writing a paper now on 195 consecutive patients that we've identified the

660
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:18,720
exact antigenic nature of what the T cell can recognize, and it can recognize in about 80% of

661
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:26,640
all histologies. And that turned out to be 363 individual antigens that were recognized in these

662
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:36,560
195 patients. And no two patients shared the exact same antigen with the exception of two

663
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:43,040
patients that had a K-RAS mutation that was recognized on a very rare Class 1 molecule,

664
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:51,760
CWA-802 HLA molecule. So just to make sure I understand that, you're saying that in this

665
01:14:51,760 --> 01:15:00,000
series of nearly 200 patients, the first interesting finding is each of them produces

666
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:09,120
at least one neoantigen that is immunogenic. 80% of patients will, yes. Okay, 80%. We haven't found.

667
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:15,680
And secondly, outside of the K-RAS overlap, they were novel across the board.

668
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:27,120
That's right. Of those 393 antigens, 392 of them were unique, not shared by any patients with the

669
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:35,600
exception of K-RAS. That's not to say that P53 or other driver genes can't recognize it, but they

670
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:42,240
don't naturally recognize it. You might be able to raise those very rare cells, but that's correct.

671
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:48,640
It's good news and it's bad news. Explain why that is to people, because I was just about to say

672
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,720
that's really good and creates a huge problem for scale. You got it. That's exactly right.

673
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,760
It's good news because we finally understand after all of these decades what a cancer antigen is. Back

674
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,120
in 1985, I knew one existed. I didn't know what it was, whether it would be shared, and we spent an

675
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,440
enormous amount of time trying to identify shared antigens, especially in melanoma, these melanocyte

676
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:26,400
antigens shared by normal pigment-producing cells. But now that we understand what an antigen is,

677
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:33,040
and we understand that most cancers contain multiple mutations, which give rise to the

678
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:41,280
antigens. Well, since almost all cancers have mutations, if we can find, figure out ways to

679
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:47,120
target these mutations that are foreign, we potentially have a treatment applicable to

680
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,560
all cancer histologies. Since almost all cancers have mutations, let's recognize them, and now

681
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,760
you don't have to worry whether it's a breast cancer or a colon cancer or a brain tumor.

682
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,760
The T cells are there. So the possibilities of developing broadly applicable treatments exist.

683
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:14,320
The bad news is, as you point out, it's going to have to be, as you target these mutations,

684
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:20,800
highly individualized treatments. Unless you can fully unleash the immune system against even the

685
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,640
most minor amnigants, which we can't do now, checkpoint modulators have virtually no impact

686
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:32,240
on the overwhelming majority of the solid epithelial cancers. It means that if you're going

687
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:39,360
to stimulate immune reactions via a vaccine or a T cell as a drug, it has to be individualized

688
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:46,720
to target that cancer, because that antigen is present only in that patient, but not in any other

689
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:54,480
patient. And that's going to make it very complex to develop. But when we develop this other form

690
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,080
of T cells, CAR T cells, a whole other story, people said that it could never be applied. But in fact,

691
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,200
if you have something that works and can cure people, the genius of modern industry will figure

692
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:10,880
out ways to make it available. Well, I wanted to go back to 1985 to pick up the story with both

693
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,160
Ronald Reagan and Tittle, unrelated but temporally related. But before we do, because you brought up

694
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:21,600
CAR T cells, let's tell the story about the diffuse B cell lymphomas that

695
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,800
ultimately led to KITE, because it's a great way to... I think most people listening to this will

696
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:32,960
have heard of a CAR T, but I think it's an important... This is an illustrative case to

697
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,880
explain how they came about, how they differ, of course, from a regular T cell receptor. And

698
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,440
as you said, how industry basically came in to solve a problem that at the outset looked pretty

699
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:50,240
daunting. So pick it up wherever it makes sense with respect to the T cell.

700
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,960
It makes sense with respect to lymphoma. So again, you have to understand the biology,

701
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:00,560
you have to go back to the biology, that normal T cells have receptors that can recognize

702
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,760
antigens on the surface of a cancer cell, right? These tiny peptides that are put on the surface.

703
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,960
Those alpha beta chains are expressed by a lymphocyte, and that's how the immune system

704
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,480
recognizes antigens. Well, there's a way to create an alternate way for a lymphocyte to

705
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,720
manage it, and it was created by some scientists at the Weizmann Institute about 10 or 12 years

706
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:29,280
ago, Zeligashar and Gideon Gross. They took advantage of antibody recognition. Now,

707
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:35,840
antibody recognition is very different than that of T cell recognition. Antibodies recognize the

708
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,680
three-dimensional structure of a molecule on the surface of a cancer cell or of any cell.

709
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,520
Not a processed peptide brought to the surface, but an actual molecule on the surface and that

710
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:54,960
antibody, like a lock and a key, will latch on to that antigen and recognize it. Well, T cells

711
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:03,680
can't do that, but by creating a chimeric T cell, you put antibody recognition domains into a

712
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:10,640
lymphocyte that converts the lymphocyte from its normal recognition from its own receptor into the

713
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:17,440
recognition of this antibody that you've put into the lymphocyte, and that expands the number of

714
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:25,200
molecules that can be recognized by T cells. And so it's this chimeric antigen receptor,

715
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:31,840
which is part receptor, normal receptor, but with antibodies attached to it that enables the

716
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,200
lymphocyte to recognize now molecules that it never was able to recognize in the course of evolution

717
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:45,120
based on antibody recognition. And it turns out that there are very few molecules on the cell

718
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:50,640
surface, very few, like I could name the few I know of and then the fingers on one hand,

719
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,720
that are unique to a cancer that are not on normal cells. And we learn the hard way

720
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,560
that the immune system will destroy a normal cell just as quickly as it will a cancer cell,

721
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:11,280
and we've mediated cancer deaths by targeting antigens that are present even in very low levels

722
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:18,640
on normal cells. Well, it turns out there's a molecule on B lymphocytes called CD19. We don't

723
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,800
exactly know what its function is, but when B cells turn into lymphomas and leukemias, they

724
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:32,960
continue to express CD19. And so with this understanding, and as soon as I heard about

725
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,400
these chimeric T cells, I invited Zellig Eshar to come to a sabbatical in my lab. He came the next

726
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:45,040
year and spent three years working in the surgery branch. And we worked out ways to use CAR T cells

727
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:50,000
to attack cancers, but we could never get them to disappear because the molecules that we were

728
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,280
giving could not be used in large enough numbers because of their ability to recognize normal.

729
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:01,440
Well, CD19 expressed by leukemias and lymphomas, they developed from normal B cells,

730
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:12,720
expressed CD19, and we developed a technique to introduce these anti-CD19 CAR molecules, chimeric

731
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:18,720
antigen receptors into T cells to create a CAR T cell that when we administered to patients would

732
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:24,400
kill every cell in the body that expressed CD19. So all the normal B cells were eliminated,

733
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:34,160
but so too were lymphomas and leukemias. And that became the first actual cell in gene therapy

734
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:42,080
ever approved by the FDA. So how did that happen? Well, we studied the ability of these anti-CD19

735
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:47,680
CAR T cells to kill cells and experimental animals, and they did. They wiped out normal B cells, but

736
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,720
you can live without normal B cells because you can give antibodies to the cell.

737
01:22:52,720 --> 01:23:00,160
Because you can give antibodies by giving antibody infusions. We used these CAR T cells

738
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:07,840
to treat the first patient ever to receive a CAR T cell. This was in 2009. This was a patient that

739
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,960
had a lymphoma that had spread throughout its chest, had been through four different chemotherapy

740
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:20,560
regimens, had enormous to kilogram tumor burdens in its body. We treated with CAR T cells that could

741
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:27,200
recognize a CD19 molecule on the surface of normal B cells and tumor, and all this tumor disappeared.

742
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:33,680
And he's, well, we treated him in 2009. He's 12 years later and completely disease-free.

743
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:43,840
We published a series of those over the course of the next two years, and we had seven or eight

744
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,200
patients who had a complete disappearance of all of their lymphoma. Diffused large B cell lymphoma

745
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:55,520
is the most aggressive form of and lethal form of lymphomas that people develop. And they developed

746
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,600
complete regressions that were ongoing for at least seemed like several years.

747
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,840
Well, once we did this, and incidentally all the patients' normal B cells disappeared,

748
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,600
but again you can live without B cells.

749
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And so in 2011, two years later after we had published several of these papers, and a year

750
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,120
after we published that work, Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania used these CD19 CAR T

751
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:30,320
cells to treat leukemia patients. And so two years after our description of multiple lymphoma patients

752
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:35,600
undergoing a complete regression, I was contacted by a former fellow named Ari Beldyren who had

753
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:42,320
worked in my lab 25 years earlier. He was, just finished his urology training, became a professor

754
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:49,760
of urology at UCLA. And he, we had become friends, and he came to see me in 2011 saying,

755
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:57,120
hey you're treating patients with these T cells, these chimeric T cells, these CAR T cells, and

756
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:03,200
successfully treating lymphoma patients. I want to commercialize this. I want to start a company

757
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:09,280
to do this. And we had had several companies come through like Johnson and Johnson brought in 12

758
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,760
people, examined everything we had done, said hey if we have a lymphoma we'll come back and

759
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,760
get treated by you, but we don't see how we can make any money doing this at Johnson and Johnson.

760
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,960
Well Ari Beldyren had a different vision. He said we can figure out a way to make this available.

761
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,720
And in 2012, we formed what's called a CRATE, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement,

762
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:34,880
that enabled us in the lab to work with this company, this biotech company, started Kite Farmer.

763
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,120
They were able to give us funds to help support the research. And so we started that in 2012.

764
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,760
We signed the CRATA. We worked together. We treated over 50 patients, showed that this

765
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:53,600
could happen, and over half of patients will undergo durable regressions.

766
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,040
He then did a multi-institutional study, and Novartis was doing this in leukemia patients

767
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,600
almost simultaneously. His multi-institutional study reproduced the results exactly,

768
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:11,920
about a 70 percent objective response rate with 50 percent durable complete regressions.

769
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:21,600
And in 2017, five years after Kite started working with us on this, Kite was sold to Gilead

770
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:30,320
for 11.9 billion dollars. That all happened in the course of those five years, and that treatment is

771
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:38,080
now available thanks to Kite and Novartis, available for use in patients in the United

772
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:49,280
States and Europe and parts of Asia that can effectively treat these B-cell lymphomas

773
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:55,840
at leukemias. So really a pretty incredible story that evolved so rapidly.

774
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:04,160
Yeah, it is. I mean, do you think that CAR T-cells can have efficacy against

775
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,000
non-hematologic cancers? Right now the answer is no.

776
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:18,320
We have no way to use them against solid cancers, again, because the solid cancer is to be treated

777
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,640
with a CAR T-cell. You have to have a molecule on the cell surface that's unique to cancer.

778
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:27,680
We originally didn't fully realize quite how sensitive they could be, and when we targeted

779
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:34,720
molecules that were on normal cells, patients died, devastating events in the development of the

780
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:46,000
treatment. But monoclonal antibodies were first described about 45 years ago, and no one has found

781
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:53,600
unique monoclonal antibodies against molecules uniquely on cancer cells and not normal cells.

782
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,040
And that's what you need to make a chimeric T-cell receptor. You need an antibody that you can put

783
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:06,400
into a lymphocyte that has specificity. And antibodies just have not evolved to recognize

784
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,440
individual cell surface molecules on cancer, which are shared by normal cells, whereas

785
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,000
conventional T-cells do, because internal proteins then get digested and brought onto

786
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,920
the surface. So right now there's very little prospect for CAR T-cells being useful for the

787
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,200
treatment of solid tumors, but that's not to say that some brilliant ideas will come forth in the

788
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,520
years to come that will make them available. Right now they're not useful.

789
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:40,880
Now, what about for organs that are not essential? So where you could waive the need to recognize or

790
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,960
differentiate between cancer and non-cancer. So for example, breast or even pancreas. If a person

791
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:52,240
had metastatic pancreatic cancer and you were willing to completely lose both normal and non-

792
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,640
normal pancreatic cells and render that person a type 1 diabetic, it would still be worth it.

793
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:04,000
So are there any antigens that are present on exclusively pancreas or exclusively breast or colon?

794
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,640
Obviously, this wouldn't work for liver and lung, but is that a slightly easier problem

795
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,080
to solve or is it just as hard? Well, it's just as hard because for the past 45 years,

796
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,240
some of the best immunologists in the world have tried to develop these monoclonal antibodies

797
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:26,800
that can uniquely recognize cancer and they have not found any. Either of course they haven't done

798
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:33,040
it right or there just aren't these molecules on the cell surface. And even very recently,

799
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,840
last several months, you probably heard about this T-immunity, these two deaths for patients

800
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:43,440
that were targeting what was thought to be a prostate specific molecule, BSMA, but it's not,

801
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:51,600
it was present on normal cells and that can result in death of patients. And so, yes,

802
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:56,560
if you could find a molecule unique to prostate cancer, breast cancer, that is expendable organs,

803
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,520
you could develop more effective cell-based therapies against them.

804
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,400
But right now, none of those molecules have been identified.

805
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:16,320
So let's now go back in time to post the IL-2 insight. You have this other amazing realization,

806
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,840
which is there are certain types of lymphocytes that manage to track to tumors,

807
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,280
these T-cells that infiltrate the tumor and they're called TIL.

808
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,480
So after we describe, I'm sorry, go ahead.

809
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,120
Yeah, no, no. So how did you come to understand these and understand

810
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,000
the efficiency with which they could identify tumors?

811
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:45,520
So things seemed to move very slowly, although we had an explosion of ideas. But looking back

812
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,480
on it, when it comes to scientific advance, it actually moved along pretty quickly.

813
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,920
Because IL-2 as a T-cell growth factor was mediating reproducible regressions,

814
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,720
it seemed reasonable that is being mediated by the ability of interleukin-2 to stimulate

815
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:10,240
lymphocytes in vivo. And so in melanoma patients, we looked for T-cells that could recognize the

816
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:16,080
tumor deposit itself. We didn't know what it was recognizing. And what better place intuitively

817
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,120
to look for a cell doing battle against the cancer than within the cancer stroma itself.

818
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:28,480
And so we grew those cells, one out of peripheral blood, but we also grew cells invading into tumor

819
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:37,120
called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or TIL cells. We grew them in vitro and in animal and

820
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:42,880
then very quickly in human experiments, grew those lymphocytes to large numbers in vitro

821
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:51,440
and administered them to patients with metastatic melanoma. And now instead of the 15%

822
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:58,480
response rate that we got from giving interleukin-2 alone, by giving lymphocytes that we grew in

823
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:06,960
interleukin-2, these TIL cells, we got response rates 30, 35% in melanoma patients. And so it

824
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,480
represented a substantial improvement, but they were pretty short durations. They were real, but

825
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:20,080
they did not appear to be durable. But it was the first demonstration that lymphocyte transfer as a

826
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:28,480
sole modality could cause tumor regression in patients with melanoma. And to some lesser extent,

827
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:35,920
kidney cancer was mediated by lymphocytes. So that intuition then became a reality of a

828
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:42,960
biologic finding and that is lymphocytes were the cause of these regressions or could be the

829
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,760
cause of regressions. And then things moved along fairly, well, slowly and quickly, depending on your

830
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:57,760
point of view. It immediately became apparent that if we had these lymphocytes naturally,

831
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:03,920
maybe we could genetically modify them to be more potent. That is, they were making factors that

832
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,240
drew other cells in. Well, let's introduce that gene into them. But no one had ever introduced a

833
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:15,680
gene into human cells. And so I teamed up with the two scientists at the NIH, French Anderson

834
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:23,520
and Mike Blais, who were trying to develop gene therapies to replace adenosine deaminase

835
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:30,560
deficiencies, a lethal deficiency in young and young children to see if they couldn't introduce

836
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:38,000
those genes. But of course, no genes had ever been introduced into people. We decided to see

837
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,840
if we could break the ice about putting foreign genes into humans by putting a marker gene into

838
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,680
the lymphocytes we were administering to patients. We picked a bacterial gene called neomycin

839
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:58,400
phosphotrazferase, inserted that gene into a patient's normal lymphocytes. And our plan was

840
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,960
to administer them so we could track where these lymphocytes were going inside the body,

841
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,080
because they would have this unique bacterial gene they were being expressed.

842
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:13,120
And so we proposed that to investigational review boards. At that point, the government had

843
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:18,880
established what's called the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the RAC, adequately named,

844
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:25,840
who had a review, any clinical proposals. We went through, we tabulated, won 17 different review

845
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:31,760
groups, having to go back and forth as they made changes until the RAC finally voted. It was a

846
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,960
painful time, 13 to 4, to allow us to do it. But the director of the NIH, James Weingarten,

847
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,160
insisted that before we would start tampering with the human genome, we needed a unanimous consent,

848
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:49,920
back and forth, making changes. Finally, there was a vote of the RAC, 13 to nothing,

849
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:55,120
0 with 1 abstention, which was unanimous. And so we got permission to proceed

850
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:01,520
with the clinical trial, biotechnology activists and filed lawsuits against the NIH, saying we

851
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,960
shouldn't be tampering with the human genome. It was immoral. It was ungodly. But we finally got

852
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,800
permission to do it and inserted these lymphocytes that were genetically modified with this bacterial

853
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,160
gene that did enable us to track the cells inside the body. When we did biopsies, it was a paper we

854
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:24,640
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And that then led to the gene modifications of

855
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:28,960
lymphocytes that we attempted to use to improve them. We put in the gene for Interleukin 2. That

856
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:34,000
didn't improve them because we couldn't regulate it. But it just started our endeavors to

857
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,520
genetically modified cells that finally came to their fruition in the CAR T cells.

858
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,480
By inserting the genes that would insert these new receptors that could recognize

859
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:52,320
molecules on lymphomas and leukemias. So that started us on the track of trying to improve the

860
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:58,240
cells. And then there were a variety of advances. We learned that you had to first wipe out all of

861
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:04,560
these inhibitory T cells, regulatory cells, before you gave the administered cells. And that then

862
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:13,920
jumped the response rates up to 55% in melanoma patients with about 25% being durable, complete

863
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:22,640
remissions. We then started developing ways to use T cells to do cancer treatment. And

864
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:29,280
2013, finally realizing that it was unique mutations, we developed techniques that

865
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:37,520
enabled us to develop T cells specifically targeting mutations. And published the first

866
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,120
paper on that in 2014. It was a patient with a bile duct cancer, a calangiocarcinoma

867
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:51,840
that was widespread in the lungs and liver. We gave her bulk T cells did not work. We gave

868
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:58,080
cells that were uniquely directed against her mutations. And she's undergone a dramatic

869
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:03,520
regression is now disease free. But those were till that were not genetically modified? Those

870
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,920
were? Those were not genetic? Those are the natural. So our work went in two directions,

871
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:14,560
genetically modifying till or figuring out ways to use natural to them. And these were natural till

872
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:22,400
that were selected for mutation reactivity and given to a patient and whose natural immune

873
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,600
system was temporarily eliminated. And she's living disease free now eight years later,

874
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:34,800
all of her liver and lung disease is gone. And we subsequently now have published on these

875
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,320
T cells that recognize unique mutations in their ability to cause regression in

876
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:48,240
cervical cancer induced by human papilloma virus, by colon cancer, that patient recognized

877
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:56,320
k-RAS, breast cancer recognized for random somatic mutations. We're now struggling to figure out ways

878
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:03,680
to more efficiently target the products of unique mutations that cause the cancer. Sort of ironic

879
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,920
that the Achilles heel of the cancer is going to be the very abnormalities that caused it in the

880
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:15,200
first place. And so that brings us up to 2021. Can we now take advantage of all this new

881
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,160
biologic information about the role of mutations and T cells that target them about the ability to

882
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:27,200
genetically modify cells in large numbers using retroviruses? Can we take advantage of that

883
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:35,200
technology, that biologic information to develop more effective immunotherapies in the years to come?

884
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,920
And that's what we're working on today. That's what we're working on in the lab as we speak.

885
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,000
Well, I want to go back a little bit and talk about a few other things, both for

886
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,480
posterity, I suppose, and also because I think there were some other things we've glossed over

887
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:57,040
quickly. But in 1985, you had this opportunity to operate on the then President of the United

888
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:03,360
States who had developed colon cancer. Why is it that you were a part of the team that would take

889
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:10,720
care of the president? Why is it that the chair of the National Cancer Institute would be involved

890
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:15,920
in the president's care? Is that something that sort of mandated at the federal level?

891
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:23,840
No, it's part of the aberrancy involved in treating high government officials. It turns out

892
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:35,840
that there is a set of modules in Walter Reed or Bethesda Naval Hospital that are set aside for

893
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:43,040
the treatment of the president. It's an isolated set of rooms. I learned this as it happened. I

894
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:49,360
didn't know it ahead of time. Where the kinds of equipment and availability of technology

895
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:55,600
was available so the president could actually run the country from his hospital bed. But it turned

896
01:39:55,600 --> 01:40:02,320
out that it was the physicians in this particular case at Bethesda Naval Hospital, and they have

897
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:10,720
marvelous doctors there, that would be treating the president. And it turned out that the chief

898
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:16,720
of surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital had just rotated off an AFFcraft carrier to be the chief

899
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:23,760
of surgery at Bethesda Naval. It would change very commonly if officers in the Navy had different

900
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:30,800
assignments. And he happened to be an expert in vascular surgery, not oncology. And he was the

901
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,680
one responsible for calling the shots about the patient's cancer. And it turned out he was an

902
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:42,800
excellent doctor, an excellent vascular surgeon, but not an oncologist. Never really was operating

903
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:48,880
on cancer patients in any volumes. And so they needed an expert in oncology to take part.

904
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,200
And just out of the blue on one Friday evening, I got a call saying, will you come over to Bethesda

905
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:58,640
Naval Hospital? We have a patient we need your help with. And it turned out to be President

906
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:05,440
President Reagan. And it was simply because I was nearby. I had previously gotten a

907
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:12,960
security clearance because I had tentatively been assigned to be part of a medical team that would

908
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:19,360
take care of high government officials in the case of calamitous nuclear emergencies.

909
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:26,880
So it was because the vascular surgeon was in charge, and I was across the street that I got

910
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,360
that I got called and took part in that, took part in that surgery.

911
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,440
And if I recall, at the press conference following the surgery, you explained point

912
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:45,760
blank that the president had colorectal cancer. And if I recall, Nancy Reagan wasn't too pleased

913
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:51,440
about that, right? No. And I'm not telling stories out of school here about a patient because

914
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:55,760
Larry speaks. It was public. Yeah, it was public information. And he later wrote a memoir that

915
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,200
described some of this. But Nancy Reagan, when we had to have a press conference and there were

916
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:09,120
little concerns about having a vascular surgeon handle the questions, and I had been an operating

917
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:17,440
surgeon as part of the operating team, she, before I went on to hold the press conference,

918
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:23,120
I remember standing backstage and she said, you cannot use the word cancer

919
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,800
in describing this because if foreign officials know,

920
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,920
think the patient has cancer, the president has cancer, they won't pay any attention to him anymore,

921
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:42,000
thinking he would not be around. And I said, I'm sorry, I can't do that. You know, if I have to,

922
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:49,360
I go out, I have to just tell the truth. And it was Don Reagan, who was the chief of staff,

923
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,960
who finally talked her off that ledge and said, look, we've just got to let him

924
01:42:53,520 --> 01:43:05,680
do what he wants to do. So we went out and the surgeon who led the discussion just basically

925
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,720
read off the PATH report, there's an adenocarcinoma, the disproportionate of the colon and so on,

926
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:18,000
and nobody understood what he said. And so they asked me to explain it. So I said,

927
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,720
the president has cancer, which got me into all kinds of trouble. I later learned that when

928
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:31,600
Vince DeVita, who is the director of the NCI resigned to become chief at Memorial Sloan

929
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,160
Kettering, I was on a shortlist to become the director of the NCI, not a position I would

930
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:42,560
have thought of accepting. And I was told at that point when I actually wrote this book in 1992,

931
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:48,960
that my name get taken off the list as someone who would become the director of the NCI,

932
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:55,920
which was very upset that I used the word has cancer, and not had cancer, that is past tense.

933
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,080
But we got over it. And the president did very well and recovered and never recovered,

934
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:08,080
never recovered from his early colon cancer. You mentioned it in passing earlier that,

935
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:14,640
although you've been in the post you're in now for 47 years, along the way you've had a few

936
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:20,160
job offers that have tempted you. I'm sure you've had many job offers. What are some of the other

937
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:26,320
ones that that tempted you, at least where you thought you could even do better work or

938
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:32,400
continue your work? Because obviously you're so mission focused. It would be a special

939
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:38,320
opportunity that I would imagine would get you to leave NCI. But what were some of those other

940
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:47,280
opportunities that you even contemplated? There were only three that I looked at once.

941
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,600
One was here at Georgetown because of a relationship I had with a surgeon in terms

942
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,880
of collaborating things, and it was sort of a favor to him to look at the job. I was also

943
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:09,280
invited to look at the job as chief of surgery at Hopkins. And ultimately I was told it got boiled

944
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:14,720
down to John Cameron and me on the short list, but I went back a second time but refused to go back

945
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:20,320
a third time because I knew I would not go to Johns Hopkins and leave the NIH. I was also asked

946
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:25,760
to look at the job at the Brigham. Remari Brennan, a friend of mine, and I were again

947
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:34,160
being pursued to accept that position. But again, I backed out. I knew that I didn't want

948
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:42,160
to take an administrative job. I wanted to be in the lab. I wanted to be mentoring fellows. I

949
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:46,000
wanted to be trying to make progress. I didn't want to guide other people making it. I wanted

950
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,400
to be there. I wanted to be doing it. I wanted to be guiding it because I thought I could do it

951
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:58,560
well. And so I actually refused any of those offers. Never looked at another job

952
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:06,480
and actually turned down opportunities to advance in the hierarchy here at the NCI

953
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:14,720
because I wanted to remain at the level that I'm at, the control of resources that enabled me to

954
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:21,600
pursue the kinds of research that I thought needed to be done in an environment of enormous

955
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:28,240
resources. So let's talk a little bit about checkpoint inhibitors. They've come up now a

956
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:38,160
couple of times in this discussion. You've mentioned anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1. Certainly

957
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:46,160
my time at the NCI, my second stint, got me very familiar with anti-CTLA-4. It was an exciting time.

958
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:51,680
And of course, James Allison would go on to receive the Nobel Prize a couple of years ago

959
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:59,440
for his work in the discovery of this. Maybe go back and explain how that system works,

960
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:07,920
how the removal of breaks works. And of course, as part of the undercurrent of this,

961
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,840
it only works if there's a tumor antigen to be recognized. In other words, taking the breaks off

962
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:19,920
when there's no stimuli doesn't do anything. But how does that system work and how is it a two-edged

963
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:28,000
sword? So again, there are stimulants and there are inhibitors of virtually every physiologic

964
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:36,320
system that we have. And one of the inhibitors are molecules on the cell surface, on the surface of

965
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:46,400
a lymphocyte, that when engaged by a receptor will inhibit a lymphocyte from developing an

966
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:53,120
immune reaction. And surprisingly, there are two molecules that have been found on the cell surface,

967
01:47:53,120 --> 01:48:01,280
now many more, that when targeted by an antibody will not kill the cell but actually turn off

968
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:10,640
the breaks that are keeping that cell's activity from exhibiting itself. So it's releasing the

969
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:17,360
breaks and it turns out to have a very important function in the body because there are some cells

970
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:23,440
that can react against normal tissues that do not react because they're being inhibited by these

971
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:30,560
breaks. And when you release those breaks, now the T cell can be very active. And it turns out that

972
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:38,240
cancer has manipulated those and by taking the breaks off, you can attack certain cancers and

973
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:44,000
explains why melanoma is one of the more common cancers to be attacked because it has so many

974
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:52,320
antigens, so many mutations. And it was a startling discovery that simply attacking a

975
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:57,680
molecule, a single molecule on the cell surface could take the breaks off a lymphocyte and let

976
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:04,240
it attack cancer. And when it comes to melanoma, kidney cancer, cancers that have large numbers

977
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:11,840
of mutations because they have a mismatch repair gene mutations, Lynch syndrome, the

978
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:22,960
MSI, the microsatellite unstable tumors, they can very strongly react against cancer. But the

979
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:28,960
common epithelial cancers that result in 90% of deaths in patients have very little reactivity

980
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,320
against the checkpoint modulator. So although they can be life-saving and very likely, although

981
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:40,720
it's been too soon, curable for some cancer patients, the overwhelming majority of cancer

982
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:46,560
patients just do not respond to taking off the breaks because when you take off the breaks,

983
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:53,120
there's not a strong enough reaction to take advantage of. But hopefully combinations of

984
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:59,360
treatments using checkpoint modulators will be more effective in the future. But it was a major,

985
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:05,040
a major step forward. And the beauty of it, easy to apply because all that required was the injection

986
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:14,880
of an antibody. So when you think about these amazing conceptual advances in the field,

987
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:24,080
the ability of CAR T cells to recognize CD19 on B cells and eradicate any lymphoma originating

988
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:33,600
from that lineage, the checkpoint modulators, NTCTLA4, NTPD1, and the durable effect that they can

989
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:44,080
have on patients in whom you have enough mutagenic burden that relieving the checkpoint is enough to

990
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:49,920
initiate it. Obviously what you've alluded to earlier with IL2, high dose IL2,

991
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,040
I don't want to at all sound disparaging, but just for the lack of,

992
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,880
let's just call that the low hanging fruit of immunotherapy, which is of course completely

993
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:06,560
ridiculous given that that's 50 years of work and countless lives. But if for the sake of being

994
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:13,680
cheeky, the low hanging fruit of immunotherapy are those pillars, do you believe that the final

995
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:21,760
frontier to go from where we are in 2021 until the point where all of those six, let's just call

996
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:30,720
the 550,000 patients with solid organ metastatic cancer who have neoantigens or 80% of them have

997
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:37,280
neoantigens that are unique to them, but not occurring in high enough frequencies that they

998
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:43,520
will respond to a checkpoint inhibitor in isolation and or in combination with cytokines.

999
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:51,520
Do you believe that there is a path for these people to be cured using adoptive cell therapy,

1000
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:58,000
either genetically or naturally occurring in some sort of a customized format? Do you think that

1001
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,880
that is the path forward from here? My intuition is very strong that the answer to that is yes,

1002
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,120
for a variety of reasons. One, we know it can work from multiple tumor types. And as I mentioned,

1003
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:21,360
we've described it and published treatment of liver tumors, bile duct cancers, breast cancer,

1004
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:28,000
colon cancer, cervical cancer. We have responses in ovarian cancer that we've published. And so

1005
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:34,160
it's no longer a question of can it work in these other cancers. The answer is yes, it can work.

1006
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:39,120
And that's a world of difference. Like before IL-2, we never knew that immunotherapy would work,

1007
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:46,800
but once it did, we knew the immune system could do it. Now we know that antigens recognized by

1008
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:53,280
T cells are present on 80% of the common cancers. And if you can develop unique reactivities,

1009
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:59,600
lymphocytes select reactivities against them and administer them, they can cause those regressions.

1010
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,760
And in fact, now, because we know the exact T cell receptor sequences that we've cloned

1011
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:12,560
and isolated, it's almost an engineering problem because since we know the receptors,

1012
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:20,480
we've now isolated libraries of receptors against P53, KRAS, that we can now use to genetically

1013
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:26,960
modify lymphocytes to turn a normal lymphocyte into a lymphocyte that can attack the cancer.

1014
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:33,040
And we have our first example of that now that we've submitted for publication targeting P53 by

1015
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:38,080
genetically altering a lymphocyte by giving it a receptor that could recognize

1016
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:44,480
some of these driver antigens. So we know it can work. And

1017
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:50,000
tell you the truth, I finally feel like I have the hang of this kind of research.

1018
01:53:50,480 --> 01:54:05,120
And that by sufficient work, creativity, this is going to be a problem that is solvable. We know

1019
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:11,520
the antigens are there, we know the T cells are there, it should work, and it can work, and I

1020
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:18,720
believe it will work as the years go on. And that's 100% of what I'm working on today, and that is how

1021
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:27,120
to utilize these unique mutational reactivities to cause the solid common epithelial cancers that

1022
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:31,680
result in 90% of all cancer deaths, how to get them to respond to immunotherapy.

1023
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:37,600
I mean, of all the eureka moments in your career, of which you've had several,

1024
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:45,200
this one seems to be the most promising, which of course, maybe they always seem that way when

1025
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:52,480
you're glowing in them. But do you see it that way? That every one of these milestones that

1026
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:58,320
came before this was vital, but this has the greatest potential, this recognition that

1027
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:05,760
virtually every solid tumor out there has novel peptides that can be recognized by a patient's

1028
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:12,960
own immune system. Right. Now realize how current this is. We published a lot of these individual

1029
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:19,840
cases that can respond. We published the first 40 or so colorectal cancers showing that mutations

1030
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:25,520
were all unique, but we haven't published much of what I've told you. So for example, none of the

1031
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:33,360
breast cancer work has been published. We now have looked at these 195 individual cancers and found,

1032
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:42,080
regardless of histology, they're there. And so it's very recent, this realization that mutations

1033
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:50,880
are the antigens and now that T cells can recognize these mutations. It's really a new world,

1034
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,200
but that happens every time you make an advance. You find the immune system can be stimulated.

1035
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:03,120
Okay, well, let's get to work on figuring out how. You know, cells can do it. Let's figure out how.

1036
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:11,360
And science works that way by incremental advances. We know this can work and I have

1037
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:17,440
every confidence that scientists around the world will figure out ways to make it work.

1038
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:24,000
That kind of reminds me of some of the important lessons that those of us who've been privileged

1039
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:30,800
enough to work alongside you have learned along the way. And I don't think you never sort of

1040
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,800
pounded the table to make these lessons, but it was abundantly clear. And one of them was no

1041
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:45,600
secrecy. There was never any secrecy. I remember working on my experiments and before data were

1042
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:51,360
published, you know, people from other labs, I don't mean other labs at NIH. I mean other labs in

1043
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,640
different parts of the country would, you know, you would encourage me to reach out to them and

1044
01:56:56,640 --> 01:57:01,920
share my results with them, even running the risk that they would quote unquote scoop me.

1045
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:08,640
But none of that mattered to you. Your goal was what is the fastest path to the accumulation of

1046
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:16,960
collective knowledge in the field? Am I accurately representing that? I don't think I'm overstating

1047
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:26,560
that. No, I've always been horrified by the secrecy that exists in medicine. And it's an ongoing

1048
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:34,880
problem. The need for biotech companies, pharmacologic pharmaceutical companies, to protect

1049
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:41,120
their intellectual property, given current patent laws, prevents them, will often prevent them from

1050
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:50,160
sharing information, from sharing reagents, and this is holding back progress. If we could somehow

1051
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:57,200
overcome this secrecy that results from either people's own personal jealousies about wanting

1052
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:05,280
to be the one who does it, or intellectual property that companies have to protect to preserve

1053
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:12,960
themselves and raise funds to continue to do their work, we need kinds of regulations that will bring

1054
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:18,640
lawyers and doctors together to figure out ways to prevent that kind of secrecy from being a part of

1055
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:25,840
modern science. It's not like we're trying to create a better air conditioner. We're trying to

1056
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:33,200
save the life of another human being. And I think when you take care of cancer patients, it puts a

1057
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:44,160
lot of things in perspective. And the idea of having a policy or a rule that you live by that

1058
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:50,000
inhibits your ability to help people who could potentially be helped is abhorrent to me. I wrote,

1059
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,440
as you know, a perspective in New England Journal of Medicine trying to change things, but they

1060
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:01,200
haven't changed. They're every bit as common today as they were back then. And as you know, the first

1061
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:06,960
thing a fellow hears in my lab when they start the first day is, look, anything you know, you share.

1062
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,720
Any experimental result you have, you can tell somebody. Any experiment you plan to do tomorrow,

1063
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:19,200
you can tell somebody about. I mean, our goal is to help people that are involved in the suffering

1064
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:26,560
of cancer. And there's no excuse for not doing everything you can to try to help. And that means

1065
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:35,360
sharing what you know. On the other side of your office, right? If one side of your office is the

1066
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:40,400
lab, the other side of your office is the clinic. The other lesson, I think, that you've infused

1067
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:47,040
into the literally hundreds. You might even be into the thousands now of people who have come

1068
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:57,280
through and trained with you. How would I say it? Basically, this idea that one never retreats from

1069
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:03,040
the bedside. One of the things that struck me, actually, especially in medical school when I was

1070
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:08,880
there because I spent the entire time on the clinic. I lived in the clinical ward. You may recall,

1071
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:14,800
I had rented an apartment in Bethesda, which I never went to except on Sundays to get new clothes,

1072
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:23,200
but I slept in the clinic. I remember that. You're quite a legend at the NIH with respect to that,

1073
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:29,680
incidentally. I mean, people thought I never left, but you never left. So it was really quite

1074
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:37,360
an experience to see you in operation there. But the thing that was hard to believe and hard

1075
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:43,920
to process until you experienced it was nine out of 10 people that walked in the door died.

1076
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:51,120
Eight or nine out of 10 of the people who walked. Because again, I think most people don't maybe

1077
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:56,880
understand because it's implicit, but it should be stated. The patients who are coming to NIH have

1078
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:02,240
progressed through every standard therapy. People aren't coming here for whom there are

1079
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:09,440
standard options elsewhere. By definition, these are patients who have the most advanced,

1080
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:16,000
the most aggressive, the most recalcitrant cancers imaginable. These are people who would

1081
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,680
probably be expected to live no more than six months without a miracle. They come to the NCI

1082
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:31,760
for those Hail Marys. If 20% of them are saved, that's remarkable, but it means 80% of them don't.

1083
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:41,920
And I think what I remember most was the way in which you described taking care of those 80%

1084
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:48,960
and fighting the urge to retreat from them because of the failure we saw in ourselves.

1085
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:58,000
How did you develop that? I mean, I assume it came naturally to you, but how deliberate has it been

1086
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:07,600
in how you teach those of us that came through? I have enormous respect for practicing oncologists

1087
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:19,280
who face this every day in their practice. It's difficult if you point out, especially when you

1088
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:23,440
get treatments that not only don't work, but actually cause some harm, which has happened

1089
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:28,480
in the course of the development of these treatments as we try to figure out exactly

1090
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:41,200
what we were doing and the right ways to do it. But I always had the feeling that I was working

1091
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:49,040
and working hard to try to improve the situation, to try to somehow repair this Holocaust.

1092
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:57,520
And that kept me going. I don't know what it must be like to be taking care of cancer patients,

1093
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,680
knowing you have limited tools at your disposal that are not good enough, and yet that's all you

1094
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:11,360
have and that's what you do day in and day out. I mean, that must be even more trying.

1095
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:19,440
And so I think one of the things that keeps me going, at least, is the fact that I'm doing

1096
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:28,880
everything I possibly can within reason to improve the situation. Without that, I think it would be

1097
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:36,960
much, much more difficult. Yeah, there are so many patients that I still remember from more than 20

1098
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:48,640
years ago who were those ones that didn't make it. And I can't imagine how haunting it is

1099
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:53,600
for you sometimes because I can see their faces, I remember their names, I remember their voices,

1100
02:03:53,600 --> 02:04:00,880
and I remember their stories. The newlywed girl who came to clinic one day, and I mean,

1101
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,080
she had literally been married for maybe three months, a beautiful 25-year-old woman

1102
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:13,840
with metastatic melanoma, and she was not one of the survivors. A young man whose name and face I

1103
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:21,120
remember every detail of single guy metastatic melanoma, and what was most tragic in his case

1104
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:31,600
was I remember everybody kind of abandoned him at the end of his life. I've said this before,

1105
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:37,920
I feel like cancer takes families that are close and brings them closer and takes families that are

1106
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:43,120
fractured and fractures them more. And I got the sense that his was fractured to begin with, and

1107
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:53,280
he was maybe 26 years old. So I certainly understand the motivation. There's no

1108
02:04:53,280 --> 02:05:00,640
lack of motivation for how you do what you do. I guess I'm amazed that you talked about how cancer

1109
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:05,920
has both these stimulants, or the immune system has the stimulatory and the inhibitory components.

1110
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:13,840
Well, it's similar that taking care of patients like this, there's the motivation that comes from

1111
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:22,320
it to do more, but at some level there's the depression of the death toll. I'm not sure

1112
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:27,760
everybody could do that. You seem to have found that balance.

1113
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:37,120
Well, you know when I lie awake at night it's not the successes that I think about,

1114
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:45,440
it's the tragedies patients that you're remembering even now that I'm sure are impacting on you. And

1115
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,520
it gets even worse because there are patients that we've killed by doing the wrong thing

1116
02:05:52,480 --> 02:06:03,840
to them, not understanding some of the underlying biology. That's the hardest thing to deal with.

1117
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:13,520
But again, given the fact that I'm doing everything that I can reasonably do to help them,

1118
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:21,920
it certainly eases the burdensome. And if you know being a doctor what an unbelievable

1119
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:27,680
privilege it is to have the opportunity to help people like that, given the skills that you've

1120
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:39,200
developed. One of the first lines of the prayer of Maimonides goes, you have been given the wisdom to

1121
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:46,480
alleviate the suffering of your brothers. And that's true in medicine because we spend a lot

1122
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:55,920
of time just learning how to help people. It's a unique opportunity in the world and in life in

1123
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:04,240
general. So there are the satisfactions that you're trying hard, even if most often things

1124
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:09,520
don't work out. But there clearly are sleepless nights involved in all of that process.

1125
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:19,280
You know, the good news is you have wonderful longevity in your family. So despite being 81,

1126
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:22,720
I have every confidence that you're going to be doing this for many more years.

1127
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:29,760
I know you don't like golf enough to hang up what you're doing for the golf course.

1128
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:38,640
I pulled this off the wall today. I wasn't sure if you still recognize these guys here.

1129
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:49,360
This is us from, I think this is 16 years ago. We both look quite a bit younger. And this is

1130
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:59,200
the only picture of me in my office, is this picture. And it speaks to what an influence

1131
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:05,280
you've been in my life. I think the list of people who have had a greater impact on the course of my

1132
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:15,120
life than you is somewhere between zero and Epsilon. It's a decidedly small list. So I feel

1133
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:22,560
forever in your debt. And though I have not been able to follow in your footsteps,

1134
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,240
your impact is greater than you could ever recognize.

1135
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:37,120
Well, thank you for saying that. That means a lot to me knowing that someone of your

1136
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:42,400
incredible intellect and perseverance feels that way. So thank you.

1137
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:51,200
I know again what a sacrifice it was for you to take time today to speak. And I know that every

1138
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:56,160
minute you spent talking with me was literally a moment you were not working on this problem.

1139
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:02,960
So I'm beyond grateful. And I know that the people watching this or listening to this are equally

1140
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:07,280
grateful. So thank you so much, Dr. Rosenberg, for everything. Well, you're very welcome.

1141
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:14,240
Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested in diving deeper

1142
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,400
into any topics we discuss, we've created a membership program that allows us to bring

1143
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:23,520
you more in-depth, exclusive content without relying on paid ads. It's our goal to ensure

1144
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:28,800
members get back much more than the price of the subscription. Now to that end, membership benefits

1145
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:34,480
include a bunch of things. One, totally kick ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every

1146
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:39,760
topic, paper, person, thing we discuss on each episode. The word on the street is nobody's show
