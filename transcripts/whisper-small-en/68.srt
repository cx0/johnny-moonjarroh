00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,480
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,840
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,520
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,440
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,920
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,120
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,920
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time, and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,080
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,440
including other things that we plan to build upon. These are useful beyond just the podcast,

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,840
especially given the technical nature of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,480
listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything episodes. That means asking questions

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,920
directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out.

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,640
Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,200
possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone,

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,440
but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,000
love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you. Again, the

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,040
podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in, one,

42
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,360
the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members to support us at

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,000
a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,280
learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,000
by signing up for a monthly subscription. My guest this week is Dr. Marty McCarry. Marty,

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,200
who's a close personal friend from residency, we overlapped when he was a fellow at Hopkins and I

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,920
was a resident, is currently a professor of surgical oncology and the chief of the Islet

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,200
Transplant Center at Johns Hopkins. And while so much of his work and professional accolades come

49
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,400
from his surgical career and the work that he does in pancreatic surgery, especially in minimally

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,360
invasive pancreatic surgery, Marty is one of the pioneering surgeons in doing one of the most

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,840
complicated operations that's ever done, which is removing the head of the pancreas minimally

52
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,000
invasively, meaning laparoscopically, something I can't even fathom because at the time of my

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,240
training, that wasn't even something that was considered. We actually don't touch on that one

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,040
bit because there's so many other things that we really wanted to talk about. The other thing that

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,080
Marty's really known for is being one of the co-creators of the surgical checklist. And this

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,200
is something that has made its way up to the WHO, Safe Surgery, Save Lives Committee. Today, many of

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,080
you, if you're ever in the hospital, if you're ever having a surgical procedure, will encounter

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,320
this checklist because it's the thing that makes sure that people don't get operated on the wrong

59
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,040
side, which is actually something that happened to me when I was in medical school. And it actually

60
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,800
is something Marty wrote about in his first book, which was a New York Times bestseller called

61
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,080
Unaccountable. And it's actually that book that became the basis for a very, very popular television

62
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,200
show called The Resident, which is based on Marty's work. We touched on that briefly, but most of what

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,680
we talk about is the material and the content that's featured in his upcoming book, The Price

64
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,040
We Pay, which will be available shortly. And this book really takes on Marty's next challenge because

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,880
if figuring out a way to do the most complicated pancreatic surgery from a minimally invasive

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,400
standpoint wasn't enough, and then going after medical errors and trying to figure out a way to

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,440
fix the system that makes it too easy to commit medical arrogance, well, if that wasn't enough,

68
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Marty's decided the next thing that he's interested in trying to address is the broken healthcare

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,560
system, which I think anybody listening to this knows in the United States is pretty clear. What

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,040
I like about Marty is he isn't one of these guys who's trying to put the single silver bullet and

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,880
blame it all on one thing. Ah, it's all drug prices, or it's all this, or it's all that.

72
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,480
What follows is a pretty nuanced discussion that it sometimes makes me really upset. There were

73
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,440
times during this interview when I just couldn't believe the stories he was telling. And I think

74
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,880
many of you will be equally upset by these things and find it totally unacceptable. But at the same

75
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,200
time, when it was all said and done, and as is often the case when these podcasts finish and the

76
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,520
mic is off, we keep talking and I think to myself, oh, I wish we recorded that. Because that was

77
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,520
probably the most interesting part of the discussion we had. But I actually came away before Marty left

78
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,720
my apartment, I came away realizing there's actually hope here. And I've actually never

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,520
felt that there was hope for this problem. I truly thought that the US healthcare system is

80
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,680
something that will drive itself off a cliff until it bankrupts us. And that is the end of it.

81
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,520
And I came away from this discussion thinking, no, there are actual steps that could be taken

82
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,480
to fix these structural errors that have allowed people with, in some cases, very good intentions,

83
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,880
in some cases, reasonable intentions, and in rare cases, horrible intentions to basically create

84
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,600
the most financially irresponsible system that I think has ever existed in the free market.

85
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,880
If you're listening to this and wondering, why does this concern you? I believe it concerns

86
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,000
almost anybody. Because anybody who's ever received an explanation of benefits that made no sense,

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,960
anybody who's ever received a medical bill that seemed ridiculous, anybody who's ever known anyone

88
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,280
who's been chased down by a collections agency, which sadly, the numbers of Americans who

89
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,840
experienced this is staggering. You'll want to listen to this because I thought I understood

90
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,920
this system well enough that I could coexist with it. I learned so much from Marty about what people

91
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,040
can do to protect themselves from this sort of predatory pricing that is, I mean, literally

92
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,160
gouging the pocketbooks of people. I think if nothing else, you will come away from this episode

93
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,040
with a greater sense of empowerment and how you can protect yourself in such situations and protect

94
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,080
the people that you care about. I'll share with you just one statistic that breaks my heart. I

95
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,640
believe it's one in four, maybe one in five women who undergo treatment for breast cancer about a

96
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,640
year after their treatment is currently being pursued by a collections agency for some sort of

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,840
ridiculous predatory pricing scheme that resulted from the treatment. To know that a patient now,

98
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,120
based on some of the work that Marty has done, have steps that they can take to put an end to

99
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,760
that kind of stuff and fight for their rights is just one of the many things in this episode that

100
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,040
kind of gave me some comfort. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with my good

101
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,720
friend, Dr. Marty Macri. Hey Marty, how are you man? Great to see you, Peter. I love that I can see

102
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,680
you twice in two days. It's awesome. Awesome. Proud of you. Everything you're doing, helping a lot of

103
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,600
people out there. So just really great to see you. Yeah, well not as many as you. You know, it's

104
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,120
funny, whenever I'm doing a podcast, I'm sort of going over a person's bio and I've had the luxury

105
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,720
of interviewing a number of friends for this podcast. And so I'm thinking to myself yesterday,

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,960
I don't really need to review Marty's bio. I know Marty, but my team was kind enough to pull the

107
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,080
bio together and they sent it to me and I was reading it and I was like, goddamn, what happened?

108
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,120
How did all of my friends leapfrog 27 steps ahead of me? And I say that without any envy,

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,480
just complete admiration. I was with Jorge Salazar a few months ago and it's just another one of

110
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,040
those examples of like all these guys that we trained with Ted Shafers, the head of urology

111
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,880
at Northwestern, Jorge's building the pediatric cardiac surgery program in Houston. I'm like,

112
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,240
when did Marty even become a professor? How did you fully, I mean, dude, you are accomplished, man.

113
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,160
Hopkins is a special place just as you've suggested and I love it just as you loved it there,

114
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,360
but I've always had a special affinity for individuals that are highly creative,

115
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,000
a little too creative for the mold in medicine. And so you're one of those guys. That's why it's

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,240
just so great to see you here and be with you. That's a kind way of putting it. There are a lot

117
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,320
of things I want to talk about, but among them of course is you've got a new book that's coming out

118
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,560
really soon and this is your third book, but really your second on the topic of medicine in

119
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,680
a pretty serious way. Let's start with your first book though, because that was, God, that's almost

120
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,600
10 years old now, isn't it? Yeah, Unaccountable. It's coming on eight years. Yeah, eight years.

121
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,960
What prompted you to write that? And of course, what some people probably don't know is that a

122
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,800
show that many people love called The Resident is actually based on that. We'll talk about the show

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,800
in a minute, but let's talk about the book Unaccountable. Yeah, Unaccountable to me was an

124
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,640
opportunity to talk about what we all talk about, but engage the general public in a way that both

125
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,840
brings honor to medicine and at the same time warns people that it's important to get a second

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,600
opinion. It's important to ask certain questions. I've always been amazed even from my days as a

127
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,080
medical student where I was lucky enough to work with two of the leaders of the field of patient

128
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,360
safety, Lucian Leap and David Bates at Harvard, and at that time they were sort of radicals. They

129
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,680
were talking about, hey, not only can you study infectious diseases or cancer, but you can study

130
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,680
the science of delivering healthcare like medical mistakes and how that harms patients, and then you

131
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,160
go from that academic concept to surgical residency where it's like you can debate on a

132
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,840
policy level, should we ration care, but like on call in the trauma bay, you're rationing care

133
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,160
every minute. It's like look on the ground, it's a different world. It's relentless. And they seem

134
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,400
completely detached by the way. Completely. There's nothing in residency that, and maybe it's changed,

135
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,560
but I'm guessing it hasn't changed that much. There is nothing to prepare you for or teach you

136
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,640
about those types of questions and decisions. Exactly. When I was at DC General City Hospital

137
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:17,320
in Washington, DC as part of my residency at Georgetown, and there was an open elevator door,

138
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,600
and somebody walked into the elevator shaft thinking that the elevator was there, but it

139
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,880
was just the shaft. Oh my god. And fell in and died. I don't mean to make light of it, but

140
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,280
it was a tragedy and they had her picture up everywhere, and the door remained in the open

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,880
position with the open shaft for three more weeks. Haven't we learned our lesson? What do you mean?

142
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,760
They didn't put a barrier? There was no barrier. There was no cone. There's no do not cross tape

143
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,360
or anything. And to me, this was like the ultimate story of how hospitals were not learning from

144
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,000
their own mistakes. And three weeks later, another person walked into this open elevator shaft,

145
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,920
and didn't die, but fell down and hurt themselves. You just think, who is watching out for the whole

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,040
ship? Who's in charge here? And those sort of experiences, and we see them all the time as

147
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,880
residents, you'd see the elevator button wasn't working to the helipad, or the person in the

148
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,440
x-ray counter refused to give you x-rays because they had their own little policy that they made

149
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,440
up. And you're just like, can't somebody just look at the whole picture? So it made me think about

150
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,760
systems, hospital systems, redesigning the delivery of care. And I think all of those questions

151
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,920
naturally open up the question of how can we do better? How do we harm people? And the lexicon is

152
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,360
tricky, right? Because if you call it a medical mistake, doctors get very, very defensive. And we

153
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,360
work so hard to get to where we are. By the way, John Cameron, who people may or may not know, maybe

154
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,240
the most famous surgeon in the United States, I spoke with him just before I came here. And he

155
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,520
told me, oh, you're going to see Peter Attia. He was the best resident we've ever had at Johns Hopkins.

156
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,880
And when you did your time at the NIH in research, he said Steve Rosenberg, who's head of the NIH

157
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,680
science surgery said Peter was the best researcher we've ever had at the NIH doing his research.

158
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,240
Anyway, we work our tails off in that residency, right? And then to have someone say, oh, you

159
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,680
screwed up. It's like, well, wait a minute. It wasn't me. It was the system or I'm overloaded.

160
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,600
And the reality is it is a systems issue. So the lexicon is important. If you call something a

161
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,000
medical mistake, then it assumes you're blaming somebody. But if you say the patient experienced

162
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,760
medical care gone wrong, it's a more patient term. Now we have a lexicon in medicine that sterilizes

163
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:46,680
everything. We call things a preventable adverse event. Just kind of washes anybody clean of any

164
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,800
responsibility. But it's medical care gone wrong. And in the pricing world, it's the same thing. If

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,600
you talk about healthcare costs, it's kind of nebulous. But if I told you the price of healthcare

166
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,280
has gotten out of control, it's like talking about gas prices versus petroleum futures or something.

167
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,520
It hits home. Medicine has a way of creating its own lexicon. And it really has a value system

168
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,240
behind it. So one of the things I've tried to do, at least with the platform that I've been given

169
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,720
from my surgical career at Hopkins is say, how can we change the lexicon? How can we look at the

170
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,840
systems and the delivery of care? How can we make sure somebody's in charge of the overall ship? So

171
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,040
the elevator door closes or somebody for the love of humanity put a cone in front of an empty elevator

172
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,840
shaft. We laugh at that example, not as you said, because of the tragedy of what took place, but

173
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:40,360
because of the absurdity of it. But what's really scary is the far less absurd errors that take

174
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,360
place. And I knew we were going to be talking about this stuff. And I sort of was trying to

175
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,000
think of some of the non absurd mistakes that I made as a resident. And more importantly, it's

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,320
the lack of a system in which one could make the mistakes. I think we just didn't know any better.

177
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,920
It's only now I had the luxury of leaving medicine for many years before even coming back to it in a

178
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,360
sort of different capacity. So I don't think it was until I fully left that I realized,

179
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,680
holy cow, that was the Wild West man. And we were doing our best. I mean, that was sort of to me,

180
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,880
one of the real beauties of being at Hopkins in addition to, I mean, I chose Hopkins as the place

181
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,240
I wanted to go because of John Cameron, who was the chair of surgery, Charlie O. Keith Lillimo. It

182
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,080
was basically three people who I had never met before I interviewed there was the reason I wanted

183
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,200
to go. Right guys. So you had these three total legends. And then you had this idea of you were

184
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,520
going to go to the epicenter of the surgical residency program. William Stuart Halstead

185
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,800
creates this program in the late 1800s. And there was this sort of lineage of what was going on.

186
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,800
You're in this place that's in theory, the best place in the world. And yet on day one, I remember

187
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,800
the responsibility I was given. And I'm thinking, Oh my God, am I good enough to do this? Am I?

188
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,160
And the other thing that humbled me was the absolute faith that the patients had in us.

189
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,680
And it really humbled me, really made me think they think I'm better than I am. They completely

190
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:17,480
trust me. And how do I balance communicating my own insecurity about even the most trivial thing?

191
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,200
I'll give you a silly example. You're pre-oping a patient and you're putting an IV in them. And

192
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,280
you're thinking to yourself, I'm not even that good at this yet. I mean, this patient is going

193
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,960
to potentially get stuck three times while I fumble to put an IV in them because the anesthesiologist

194
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,360
couldn't be here right now to do it. And I'm sort of filling in. And yet they're stoically sitting

195
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,880
there thinking, well, I'm at Johns Hopkins. I think that's the nature of a teaching hospital.

196
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,640
So that's part of what we're supposed to be doing. But when it starts to get to the really serious

197
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,120
stuff, I think there were many times when certainly I felt like I was out of my lane.

198
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:57,800
You realize you walk into this incredible lineage historically of public trust in the profession.

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,520
And a patient you meet in the emergency room will trust you to put a knife to their skin within

200
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,400
two seconds of meeting you or the tell you secrets they've never told their spouse of 30 years

201
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,760
just because you're the doc. And it's this incredible sort of awe inspiring, wow,

202
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,880
they trust me more than I trust myself. I remember trying to put a central line into a difficult

203
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,000
patient, you know, at 3am. The patient probably didn't even need the line that we put in central

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,240
lines and everybody. I was putting central lines with people in the parking lot practically when

205
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,880
I was in the turn. You didn't want to have your chief resident walk in and say, why doesn't this

206
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,200
patient have a central line and lose it? So you just put a central line and everybody on this

207
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,280
service for fear of getting yelled at. It was just absurd the things we used to do like that.

208
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,000
And I remember one night I tried to put a central line, couldn't get it, and I signed it out to the

209
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,200
other resident. And I said, I tried, I couldn't get it. I tried, I don't know, five, six times.

210
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,320
And then he went to do it. And he said, I was able to get it. By the way, I think you tried more than

211
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,680
five or six times. I said, what do you mean? He says, oh, there were 20 introducer holes in the neck

212
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,560
area where you went in. And I thought, gosh, the patient was ventilated. They were intubated. I just

213
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,120
had no idea how difficult it could be. And the mantra was you just try again and again until you

214
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,600
get something right. That's the surgical mentality. That's sort of the ideas that you will perfect it.

215
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,640
And if it takes a million times, it takes a million times. Yeah. So what year did you start

216
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,360
working on that book? I mean, you and I had spoken about some stories that even ended up in the book

217
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,640
years before. So obviously the idea had been with you for probably 10 years. But when did you actually

218
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,600
like kind of put pen to paper and start saying, I'm going to do this thing. I remember telling my dad,

219
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,520
who's a hematologist or leukemia lymphoma expert, I remember telling him that I was seeing things in

220
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,280
the hospital as a student and as a resident that were just mind boggling. And I couldn't really

221
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,720
grasp with the collision of sociological issues to see us spend a million dollars rescuing a patient

222
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,520
only to go out and have them repeat that behavior that brought them in or a new medication finally

223
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,480
get invented in the pharma world and brought to the bedside. But docs just didn't feel like giving it

224
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,560
or weren't aware of it. And you thought, wow, the implementation science of medicine is more

225
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:24,200
challenging than the discovery science. And if you can invent Kevlar, but people don't wear it,

226
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,000
it's a failure of the delivery or implementation. I thought this is where the opportunity is.

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,160
And then I think, you know, part of things in my career were right time, right place, right? That's

228
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,360
when everyone started to say, Hey, wait a minute, we could deliver care better, safer, more reliably.

229
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,840
But I told my dad these stories about stuff I was seeing. And there's this one patient,

230
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,840
who basically didn't want anything done. Sometimes as a resident, you connect with a patient

231
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,360
at the bedside and you realize they really don't want this surgery that they're going to have done.

232
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,680
And you communicate that to your team. And you were great about communicating. You had no

233
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,160
hesitations to say, this is what the patient believes, or I'm concerned about this. And

234
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,840
hyper communicators do great in surgery. They do great in medical school, they do great in surgery.

235
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,640
They're annoying in the real world. But in surgery, you want that nonstop communication.

236
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,680
Are you going to the emergency room? Should I come with you? Are you going to get these lab tests?

237
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,080
Where should I stand in the operating room? Those are the communicators we love. It's always amusing.

238
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,360
I have every now and then a parent who will call and say, my son who's in high school,

239
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,320
wants to go to Hopkins Medical School, can you help him or talk to him? He has amazing hands.

240
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,840
He was putting puzzles together at age two. It's like, they're all learned techniques. Okay,

241
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,680
there's no gifted hands. They're all learned techniques. And by the way, we're not going to

242
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,720
help any one kid give him preference in getting into med school. But you realize there was this,

243
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,480
when I was a resident, there was this patient who just did not want surgery. And the doctors insisted

244
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,480
that she have this invasive biopsy in order to figure out what the cancer type was. But the

245
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,480
CAT scan essentially said it was clear what this cancer type was. And the biopsy was just to

246
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,600
confirm it. And I remember the patient just... But regardless of that, she didn't want the

247
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,840
surgery to remove it, period. Yeah. Presumably she was old or... Yeah, she was old and she lived alone

248
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,400
and she didn't want the biopsy, the invasive biopsy. She wouldn't want a surgery to remove it

249
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,960
if the biopsy confirmed. So she was basically saying, I just want to go home and sort of live

250
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,960
the last few weeks, months of my life in peace. Yes, leave me alone. And I thought, well, maybe

251
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,160
it's important to prognosticate to tell her, you've got maybe two months or you've got six months.

252
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,360
The reality is we never really know. Like we have any clue. Yeah, exactly. So I remember telling the

253
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,240
team, she didn't want anything done. Well, we have to do the biopsy because we don't know what it is.

254
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,120
I'm like, well, she doesn't care what it is. We have to get it. Well, why do we have to get it?

255
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,960
No, we have to know. And I'm just looking at this train that just will not stop and listen to

256
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,720
patients. And I'm thinking, how did we get to this point where we just do stuff on people who

257
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,760
don't want things done? And you look on a broad scale now, as I've been researching the cost

258
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,800
crisis for this new book, The Price We Pay, healthcare is now the number one industry in

259
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,480
the United States. It is the number one business as of January 2018. Entire cities have been

260
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,240
transformed. I mean, look at Pittsburgh. It used to be a big steel town in my home state of

261
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,400
Pennsylvania. Look around, it's all healthcare. All the tall buildings are healthcare, health

262
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,200
insurance, health administration. And you realize how did we get to a point where we've created this

263
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,880
train that sometimes doesn't listen to patients? And my dad said, write these stories down,

264
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,160
Marty, because you'll be amazed how you forget when you go on. And someday you'll be teaching

265
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,080
residents and students. And these are important things to remember. And that's when I started

266
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,000
writing things down for the book on accountable. The TV show, The Resident, by the way, did a

267
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,760
beautiful, and it brought a tear to my eye, they did a beautiful description of that case,

268
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,400
where that patient wanted nothing done. And the TV show, the patient simply said,

269
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,800
I want to go home and clean the garage. I don't want to leave my wife with a mess. I've accumulated

270
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,800
over my lifetime. It was beautiful. To me, that was the most amazing part of being a part of that

271
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,040
show. Yeah, my mother-in-law is obsessed with that show. And she didn't realize it was based on you

272
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,600
and your book. And of course, for the listener, my mother-in-law, it was kind of a funny story here,

273
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,320
because she used to work for Charlie Yeoh, who was one of these legends that drew me to Hopkins.

274
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,960
And so she was actually one of the first people I ever met at Hopkins, because the day I showed up,

275
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,720
I wanted to go and meet Charlie Yeoh. So I went up to the office like an eager literal intern with

276
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,840
my tail between my legs. But she just had like a soft spot in her heart for me. And when she knew

277
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,680
I was talking to you today, she just couldn't tell me as many times as how many times I needed to

278
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,120
tell you how much she misses you and how excited she was when I was talking to you. But anyway,

279
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,960
it's her favorite show for me to be able to say, you know, that's about Marty, right? She's like,

280
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,080
what? Oh my God, no. I mean, it went from being her favorite show to, I don't know, like a deity

281
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,520
of TV or something. By the way, your mother-in-law Janet was wonderful. And one of the reasons why

282
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,440
we all loved her so much as a resident was here's a normal caring person in the department of surgery.

283
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,320
You can actually talk. They would listen. Was it like, suck it up and move on? So it's here's like

284
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,440
a normal healthy human ombudsman in the middle of Navy SEAL training. And it's like, oh my gosh,

285
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,160
she'll hug us. And she had just feelings and she was kind. So we all loved her. But yeah, I try to

286
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,720
lay low with the show because there's nothing really good that comes out of associating your

287
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,560
name with a show like that when you have no editorial control. And even the first couple

288
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,200
episodes I learned in retrospect, there was a low budget. Now the show's crushing it and they'd

289
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,080
spend four or five million dollars a show. And but back then when it was a tight budget, they had,

290
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,840
for example, an episode in the early parts where a medical coder was rounding with the doctors in

291
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,800
the CT scan room and telling doctors they need to order this test. And it was like, come on, no coders

292
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,920
are rounding with us. And then over time in their budget and they got more people involved, they

293
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,640
really beefed it up. And now it's really a drama about the business of medicine, the TV show The

294
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,240
Resident, whereas previous medical dramas have been about sort of the medical side and medical care.

295
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,840
So this is an attempt to really look at the business of medicine. When did you meet Peter

296
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,720
Pronovost? Did you know Peter before you got to Hopkins? No, I met him. I met him in the ICU.

297
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,560
He's an ICU doctor, as you know. And so I met him in the ICU. And then when you get on faculty at

298
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:34,920
Johns Hopkins, they assign you an official mentor. So he was assigned as my mentor. And we had offices

299
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,360
next to each other. And he started talking about, gosh, we're using this checklist in the ICU when

300
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,200
we round to make sure we're covering all these points. Like what day of antibiotics is this

301
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,480
patient on? Let's anticipate where they're going to go after they leave here and how can we make

302
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,760
preparations. So that's where I got to know him. Yeah, he was incredible. I always think back to

303
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,480
my time at Hopkins is unbelievable. Like I just felt too lucky to be there. And I just couldn't

304
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,920
believe like everywhere you went, there was this person who was exceptional and arguably the best

305
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,400
in the country, if not the world at what they did. And certainly Peter, there's no exception.

306
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,120
Interesting as an aside, when I decided to leave medicine, a lot of people thought you were making

307
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,760
the biggest mistake of your life. Peter was one of the few people. And by the way, the people who

308
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,560
said that and felt that way did it out of complete compassion and concern. So nobody was nasty about

309
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,600
it. But Peter, he gave me a book by Joseph Campbell and said, read this, I think it will help.

310
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,480
And he was the most understanding person about it. He was like, no, Peter, you know, I think you'll

311
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,200
be a decent doctor. But if you choose to leave the practice of medicine, I completely supported and

312
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,720
proud of you. And I've never forgotten that Peter was sort of the first person who kind of accepted

313
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,680
my decision to leave. We were so torn, by the way, because we had these conversations we were

314
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,640
thinking about leaving. And I thought, gosh, you're so creative. This place beats creativity out of

315
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,320
you, this cookie cutter job. So run with that creativity. But on the other hand, we loved

316
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,440
working with you. It was like having a reliable, solid doc to work with is the best part of the

317
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,600
job. So that's anyway. Well, the good news is there was so many of those at Hopkins. I mean,

318
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,080
I felt like my absence certainly didn't change anything because it was just honestly, I felt

319
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,360
like everybody there was we joked about it was sort of like what it must have been like to play

320
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,760
for the Yankees, right? Everywhere you look, there's like the best person at whatever they were doing.

321
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,800
But how much resistance did you get from the field? Because I got to feel like writing that book

322
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,360
ruffled some feathers. And again, you do a very good job in unaccountable of not turning this into

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,840
a holier than thou crusade, your self-deprecating. I mean, but nevertheless, in some ways, it's one

324
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,080
of the first times an insider said with vulnerability, look, we're not perfect here.

325
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,800
We're struggling and we don't have a system that's great. It wasn't some sensational whistle blowing

326
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:57,560
nonsense. It was almost a cry for help. But we come from a culture and this isn't just Hopkins.

327
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:03,640
I think this is medicine of a very stiff upper lip. You suck it up and you do it and you're doing

328
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,000
the best you can because our intentions are good. I mean, I can only recall two residents in the

329
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,200
entire time I was at Hopkins that were just bad people. And when you think about how many residents

330
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,240
would come through that program, that's less than 1%. So there's less than 1% of the residents I saw

331
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,120
at Hopkins were just horrible human beings. So we got all these people who are good and they're

332
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,360
trying to do the best they can. And there is this veil of secrecy. And you come along and you say,

333
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,480
we're not doing good enough. Like we could be doing better. And I'm going to share with the outside

334
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,440
world for the first time what this means. So did someone like sit you down and say, Marty,

335
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,800
shut the hell up. I tried to make it very personal. And like you say, I tried to point out where I've

336
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,400
made a mistake in taking care of patients. I tried hard to basically say, look, I'm a human

337
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,560
being. We're all human beings. We're going to make human mistakes. Let's not blame the human being.

338
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,360
Let's talk about how we minimize those mistakes, how we create safety nets when they do occur,

339
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,560
and how we talk openly and honestly about them so that we don't go home with little PTSD because

340
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,480
it is a horrible feeling when you're involved in those things. But I tried to tell my own story of

341
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,520
observing in residency at an affiliate hospital, a woman walk into a place that was a branded

342
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,040
breast cancer center. And it really wasn't there was somebody there practicing outdated breast

343
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,920
care. They didn't offer all the surgical options. They didn't offer any trials. And I just thought

344
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,040
this is dishonest to the patients. Now, what do you do with that observation? Do you internalize it?

345
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,240
I remember telling my dad once about a surgeon who shouldn't have been operating. And we've all

346
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,640
seen them. They're everywhere. I mean, most surgeons do the right thing and always try to.

347
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,400
And we don't want to create hysteria. But you do see this 5, 10, sometimes 15% of surgeons that

348
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,480
should not be operating. And I told another doctor in the hospital about what I witnessed in the

349
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,840
operating room and how it was an entirely avoidable and it was a skill issue. And the doctor just kind

350
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,480
of put his head down and said, yeah, that's too bad. And I thought, is that how we help each other?

351
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,360
Is that how we police ourselves? There's got to be a better system. And at a certain point,

352
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,480
you realize, okay, the state medical boards, it's not really a feasible way to help outliers.

353
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,280
The departments, they're not always incentivized or driven. Generally, we respect everybody's

354
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,120
autonomy. Hospitals are profiting from the individuals, not that they want anything bad

355
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,160
to happen, but they're just not financially aligned to really intervene. Typically, I don't

356
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,000
want to make a broad statement there, but no one is in nobody's direct interest. And so I realized

357
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,200
we've got to educate patients on second opinions. We've got to educate patients on the questions to

358
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,400
ask. And I tried to be very honest about the issue. Now, the one problem with the book,

359
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,360
Unaccountable was the title. The publishers slapped their own titles on it. And I, of course,

360
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,920
had a positive title on it. And they come back, no, we're going to call it Unaccountable and this

361
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,640
subtitle. And of course, I'm thinking that's not going to fly well with the medical profession.

362
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,760
It might sell more books. And they had title rights. And I've learned I probably got burned

363
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,520
on that title a fair bit because of the 10% of doctors that contacted me, most doctors said,

364
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,520
thank you for speaking up, or I've seen this, or this is going on here. But the 10% of doctors that

365
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:25,720
gave me negative feedback, I'd say, nobody of those doctors read the book, but they actually

366
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:33,480
just reacted to the title or the title of a book review. And the media sensationalizes the topic of

367
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,160
patient safety. And it's very difficult as a patient safety researcher to treat the subject

368
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,400
in a way that the media is fair and balanced because what they want to do is just they're all

369
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:50,120
in the ratings business. I remember Fox News wanted to do a one hour special on this topic and had me

370
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,600
in it and yes, doctor, this is important. We want to help this effort and patient safety. And then

371
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,920
they call the show the night before it comes out, they call me and they say, the show's coming out

372
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,800
tomorrow. It's called doctor death or something like, or something like, come on, you know, I

373
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,600
thought you were going to treat this. And so that's the issue with patient safety researcher. To be

374
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,360
very honest, I'm thankful that I'm no longer a researcher in patient safety. And my entire

375
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,520
research effort has moved on to the cost crisis in healthcare because during that era, a 10 year

376
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,560
era when we were doing a lot of research on patient safety, working on the surgical checklist,

377
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,520
the media was sensationalizing the subject a lot. And the profession, to be honest, if somebody had

378
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,120
a medical mistake, a patient was complaining, they were sort of relegated as crazies. They were just

379
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,880
kind of put out there. Any malpractice claim that was resolved had a gag rule that I wrote about it

380
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,280
non-accountable. So you could not speak to anyone for the rest of your life about your medical

381
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,920
mistake. Well, mistakes happen and gagging somebody is tragic because talking about the

382
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,880
mistake is part of the therapy, not just for the patient, but for us docs. Well, I'm glad you said

383
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,400
that because there are several things that I still feel upset about from residency. Again,

384
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,360
they're not specifically directed towards any individual or even the program itself, but more

385
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,400
the overall culture. And this is one of them, as you probably recall, there was a very clear rule.

386
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,240
Now it obviously wasn't a written rule. It was an unwritten rule. But whenever there was an outcome

387
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,200
that was not desirable, so that meant the patient died, even if there was no mistake involved or

388
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,000
obvious mistake, but patients die. Hopkins doing the most complicated surgery that can be done on

389
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,880
this planet. And because it's a huge tertiary center, you're getting people from all over the

390
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,480
world who are coming with the biggest problems. Invariably, people are dying. Well, the rule was,

391
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,680
the unwritten rule was if there was even a chance there was going to be a lawsuit involved,

392
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,840
you weren't permitted to speak with the family. And so, and I remember this very clear one night

393
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,640
when I was an intern and I was in the wick you. So one of the ICU's at Hopkins, this patient had

394
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,520
been on our service for patient had been in a hospital for probably three months. I was just

395
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,840
coming off the end of being on one of the, so I actually, I wasn't the wick you resident. I was

396
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,280
on one of the surgical teams, but you're taking care of the patient in the ICU. And one night I'm

397
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,680
on call and this is kind of the end. I think the family withdrew support and this patient died.

398
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,560
And so I'm filling out the death certificate and his wife comes up to me and it's two in the morning

399
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,880
and she just wants to talk. I mean, she just wants, their kids aren't there yet. They're probably not

400
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,840
going to be there till the morning or whatever. So I just talk with her. And again, there's no

401
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,160
blaming. This is just a, she's questioning, Oh my God, should we have even done this surgery?

402
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,720
The gravity of this is starting to weigh in. It's a typical situation of a patient who was probably

403
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,640
in his late seventies who had an aggressive surgery for a cancer. And yeah, maybe in retrospect,

404
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,840
it wasn't the right thing to do. Did anybody make a mistake there? No. Even if somebody made a

405
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,200
mistake, it's remarkable how patients are forgiving. They just want honesty. They're hungry for honesty.

406
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,080
Absolutely. And so I remember kind of the next morning getting spanked a little bit by the chief

407
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,320
resident when he found out you were talking to Mrs. Smith for an hour last night. Like, how dare you?

408
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,800
Right. Our job at this point is to make sure that if their lawyers call and want the medical records,

409
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,520
we get them to them in a timely fashion, we cooperate and I'm like, what the hell are you

410
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,040
talking about? Why is that what we're thinking about at this point? And as myself being a victim

411
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,440
of a medical mistake, which you wrote about actually in the book, I was amazed at how well

412
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,360
you knew that story. I don't even like, it's funny. I remember when you sent me the gallery of that,

413
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,480
I was like, I can't believe Marty remembers all this stuff because I have total hippocampal

414
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:50,120
wipeout from residency. I remember huge blind spots I have, but I never wanted to sue the surgeon who

415
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,160
did this stuff to me, but I was definitely upset about the fact that he wouldn't talk to me.

416
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,720
It was surgery gone bad, if you will. I feel like I may have told the story before, but I had a wrong

417
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,920
side surgery. When the surgeon operated on the wrong side of my spine, something went wrong. I

418
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,880
woke up from the surgery in worse shape than when I went in and for three weeks he refused to

419
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,840
acknowledge anything was wrong. I was seeing him in clinic. He actually called me a pussy and told

420
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,480
me to suck it up. He was a horrible human being. There's no question about that. Not because of

421
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,560
this, it just, this guy was a horrible human being who happened to do this, but what amazed me was

422
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:30,760
the complete and utter lack of honesty. I mean, just, and to this day people say to me, how did you

423
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,440
not sue him, sue the hospital? And I said, look, maybe it's because I'm Canadian and we're just not

424
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,200
litigious people, but it was never about that. This wasn't something a dollar was going to solve for me.

425
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:49,560
I just wanted a guy to be able to say, oh my God, Peter, I can't believe in all, and I understand

426
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,720
how the mistake happened. It was VIP treatment. That's the problem. So I'm a medical student at

427
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,760
Stanford. I've got this huge finding on the MRI. They want to get me right to the OR. It's a Sunday

428
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,200
night. We're going to pre-op you first thing in the morning. You're going straight away.

429
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,840
Didn't even meet the surgeon. No physical exam. It was a perfect and colossal mistake

430
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,320
that was the result of a whole bunch of people trying to do the right thing as quickly as possible.

431
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,120
And in all of the hoopla, they got the side wrong. Yeah. It's always the case with VIP care,

432
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,320
isn't it? If you're a VIP, do not tell anybody. Yeah, exactly. Do not get VIP care. Do not say

433
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,040
you're on the board or have a buddy who's a doctor. Just your average Joe walk it in

434
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,520
and ask all the right questions. Yeah. But you went through it. I mean, that was a lot.

435
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,080
But people are just hungry for honesty. And you know, unfortunately now the risk managers

436
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,200
of hospitals have dominated the practice of medicine. When things go wrong, they basically

437
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,520
create this deny and defend mentality. So you're saying that's gotten even worse.

438
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,880
It's got well, I personally think that hospitals are making too many decisions based on what the

439
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,880
risk managers are telling them to do. Because from a risk management standpoint, legally,

440
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,800
and this is with any corporation, it's not just medical, you want to basically shut off

441
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,560
communication, deny and defend, hold your party line and fight it in court and in the settlement

442
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,720
process and depositions. But in medicine, people want honesty, they're forgiving and they want to

443
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,080
understand what happened. And it's remarkable. I had a patient once who said that surgeon wasn't

444
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,440
able to do this in the surgery and they sent the patient here to Hopkins. And I said, well, yeah,

445
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm sorry, you went through that. Yeah, us too. But you know, our surgeon did his best and he offered

446
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,920
for us to come here initially to Hopkins. And we said, no, we'd really want to stay here in North

447
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,640
Carolina. We'd like you to go ahead if you feel comfortable. And there was so much honesty, you

448
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,880
realized people don't really sue because things go bad. They sue because things go bad and there's no

449
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,120
honesty and transparency. Well, and I think there are data to support that because I remember in

450
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,880
residency getting kind of annoyed by this situation of when bad things happen, you're not allowed to

451
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,560
talk to the family. And I remember pulling out some, this was soft research, but the takeaway

452
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,600
seemed very clear to me, which was lawsuits happen when communication breaks down independent of the

453
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:17,640
severity of the outcome. So you can have lawsuits over bad communication when the outcome was not

454
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,040
really that bad. You order the wrong diagnostic test on a patient, for example, they're not hurt

455
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,880
from it. They were exposed to maybe more radiation than they should have been. And that's bad, but

456
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,160
that's different than you operate on the wrong carotid artery. But it seemed that the lawsuits,

457
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,680
the severity of any sort of litigious behavior was much more proportionate to everything that

458
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,080
happened after the breach. Absolutely. I mean, again, that was my very kludgy takeaway 15, 20 years ago.

459
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,120
Is that still, did the data bear that out? Yeah, well, the studies show that satisfaction of the

460
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,040
patient is the bigger driver rather than the actual event. So if the patient is extremely satisfied,

461
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,640
the risk of a lawsuit is low. And that's why I tell docs when something goes wrong, reach out to

462
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,040
the patient immediately and disclose I had a patient where I ordered a CAT scan and they

463
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,480
shouldn't have had a CAT scan. I remember you told the story once and this patient didn't like you

464
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,440
in the first patient was already pissed at me. The patient had a pancreatic leak, which is 20,

465
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,640
30% of all pancreatic surgery, they struggle with a leak that keeps them in the hospital longer,

466
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,320
they feel sick afterwards. And I basically went to this patient thinking, gosh, this guy's going to

467
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,760
sue me in a similar name to another patient. And when I talked to the resident who then talked to

468
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,400
the clerk at the nurses station, something broke down. I might have not been clear. I might have

469
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,040
said the wrong name. I don't remember. I was busy. The resident might have passed the wrong name.

470
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,120
The clerk may have entered the wrong name. Who knows? We're not going to have an investigation.

471
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,600
But I went to the patient and I said, look, I made a mistake here. Something went wrong.

472
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,920
I take responsibility. You shouldn't have had that CAT scan. It was not intended for you.

473
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,680
It was intended for another patient on this floor. I mean, this is the stuff risk managers just vomit

474
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,880
when they're here. They're like, shut up. Come up with an excuse. Because it's plausible that you

475
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,360
would do a CT scan on a patient with a pancreatic leak. You could have easily gone in there and said,

476
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,760
Mr. Smith, I just wanted to be doubly sure that the leak was contained.

477
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,520
So the guy looked at me and I said, I'm happy to get the results right now. As soon as I found out

478
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,440
about it, I came up here to tell you, I'm happy to go down and get the results right now. I haven't

479
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,920
seen the results yet and share them with you. We can just see what the CAT scan showed. This guy,

480
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,120
he already had sort of an angry look on his face. He was already upset. I think idealistic expectations

481
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,720
of how his recovery should have gone. And he looked at me and this guy put a big smile on his

482
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,480
face and he said, Doc, thank you for coming up here and explaining this to me. I really appreciate

483
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:50,920
your honesty about it. That guy never sued me. Okay. We are Facebook friends today because he

484
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,600
just hit me. People are hungry for honesty in medicine. Now, honestly, when you make a mistake

485
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,160
and someone dies, you need to talk about it. I mean, I hear every now and then about a tragic,

486
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,480
horrible, avoidable case. And my first reaction is I want to talk to that cardiology fellow or

487
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,680
whoever was involved and let them know this happens to all of us. We're human beings. Things

488
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,760
are going to happen. Let's talk about how to prevent it. How do you feel about this? We've got

489
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,720
a talk through because I'll tell you when we internalize, it's bad for our bedside skills.

490
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,720
We turn into robots. I don't know if you saw the movie Hurt Locker, where this guy's diffusing

491
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,600
bombs in the middle East. Then he comes home and his wife is telling him like, go pick up some

492
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,040
cereal in the supermarket. And he's just looking at these cereals like, what's this matter? I'm in

493
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,080
a war overseas and who cares what cereal he can't do the activities of normal living. American

494
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,640
sniper, the same thing. He's a hero in war. And then he comes home and he's watching his kid and

495
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,960
daycare his wife's trying to engage with him. And he's just a robot. And that is exactly what

496
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,960
we doctors go through when you're in the ICU, you're in the trauma bay and somebody has a tragic

497
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,120
illness and you're yelling and screaming to get a chest tube in and you go home. Unless we address

498
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,320
it head on, unless we talk about it, unless we can't cope. And the way we tend to cope is we just

499
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,600
internalize it. I'm always laughing when one of my friends says, I went on a date with a doctor and

500
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,800
he didn't have any emotions. And he just started talking about different incisions he would use on

501
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,120
the scalp to approach a brain tumor. And I'm like, we internalize too much at the hospital. And it's

502
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,040
important to have these honest conversations. By the way, this is what I love about the students.

503
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,440
The students have like very little tolerance for BS. I guess it's just part of this millennial

504
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,240
generation. So when they see stuff in the hospital, they call it out, wait a minute,

505
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,120
this lady didn't want to biopsy. Why are we doing the biopsy? Ho, ho, wait a minute. They don't care

506
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,600
about how it's going. It's very different from us. Totally. Because students, we were head down.

507
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,600
When someone says jump, we say, oh, hi. You fall in line. I mean, do you remember the twist,

508
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:06,360
which was this pastry on the tray, on the catering tray at M&M conference at Hopkins

509
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:13,080
for many years? Yeah. Yeah. That was the NAFLD T2D special. Right. Exactly. But the word was

510
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,880
John Cameron, the chief of surgery, loved the twist. And there's only one twist on the tray.

511
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,000
If any resident or med student took it, it was like the biggest faux pas. You could do not touch

512
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,800
the twist. And they would literally orient you like, here's how you call the blood bank. Here's

513
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,720
where you send the labs in and don't touch the twist at M&M conference. Part of the four things

514
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,480
they tell you when they start orient the students. And I heard one day, I wasn't there, but I heard

515
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,040
one day they found a student who'd showed up early for conference and he was halfway through the

516
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,280
times. And they were like, what are you doing? No. We've got to get another twist sent up here.

517
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,520
Get another twist emergent stat. They're trying to do the Heimlich on them and preserve the remaining

518
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,480
piece of the twist and make a clean cut and prepare their apologies. I mean, that like you're

519
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,440
saying, we just fell in line. It was the military. And gosh, I remember patients struggling in the

520
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:13,880
ICU. Their oxygen saturations were low, but it was 627 and it took me three minutes to walk to

521
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,600
M&M conference and you were never late for that conference. And I'm literally like, nurse, can you

522
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:24,360
just manage? I have to go. I have to. This is absurd. This patient's struggling in the ICU

523
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:29,880
with this incredible, I've never seen anyone show up late to that conference in my 16 years of

524
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,560
conference at Hopkins. And it's just amazing, this militaristic. And the reality is we should be at

525
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,800
the vet, whatever the patients need, we should be there for them. But there's this culture and it's

526
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,560
changing. So I love the students. The students are the most exciting part of the job. They are with

527
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,520
the pricing failures that we're writing about now in our research. They are going after these

528
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,720
predatory billing practices and they're saying, excuse me, what the hell? You build a patient

529
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,160
$10,000 for a CAT scan. And they've started this movement called restoring medicine.

530
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,080
They've got a Facebook group. They've got these are medical students at Hopkins. Yeah, medical

531
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,000
students at Hopkins and around the country. They're just trying to get a grassroots thing going.

532
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,680
They did this on their own. They approached me and they said, look, we love the book. The price we

533
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:19,560
pay. We want to work on this. These are our patients that are getting harassed for their

534
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,440
medical bills. The patients did not come to the hospital administration or billing department

535
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,800
for medical care. They came to us, the doc, and now they're getting shaken down with these egregious

536
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,720
overpriced surprise bills. It may be that this is going to be the number one issue in the next

537
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,120
election. There's some early polling from the LA times that are showing it's not just healthcare.

538
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,320
That's the number one issue in America at the voting polls. It's medical bills in the midterm

539
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,960
elections, Trump's first term in the midterms. Healthcare surprised everybody. It was the number

540
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,040
one issue. They didn't think it was going to be that high. That was not the Obamacare debate. That

541
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,920
was people getting hammered with medical bills. And the students right now are saying enough is

542
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,240
enough. That generation demands transparency in every aspect of life. There's so much I want to

543
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,800
talk about on this front because that's the subject of your book and the stories that you tell in

544
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,240
that book just they really resonate with me. But I want to tell a funny story just because you've

545
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,760
brought up John Cameron and he is such a god to me. As you pointed out, the Hopkins medical

546
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,120
students are probably the best medical students in the country. And so that was sort of one of the

547
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,840
privileges of being a resident there was for the listener, there's a real hierarchy in medicine.

548
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,720
So you have the attending, that's the faculty member. You have the fellow, so they've finished

549
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,640
their residency, but they're now doing some additional training. You have the chief resident

550
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,360
who's the most senior resident. So they're still in training. You have sort of mid-level resident,

551
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,560
junior resident, intern, sub-intern, which is still a medical student, but in their final year

552
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,640
and then the third year medical student. I mean, that's basically the entire hierarchy. So one of

553
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:58,360
the real privileges of being at Hopkins was even as an intern, you got to scrub in with Dr. Cameron

554
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,840
when he was doing a Whipple procedure. You got to retract and you got to remove the gallbladder.

555
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,160
You have the privilege of being yelled at if you're really lucky.

556
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,520
Well, I mean, it's funny because if you were in the general surgery categorical program,

557
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,200
you couldn't wait to get in there and do that. Now, of course, if you were one of the neurosurgery

558
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,720
residents, that might not be as appealing because you're like, oh my God, I just got to get through

559
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,080
this thing, but I loved it. So anytime I got to be in the OR with Dr. Yoh, Dr. Cameron was like the

560
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,680
greatest day of my life. And I didn't care if I got yelled at a hundred thousand times and I

561
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,840
didn't care if my fingers went numb trying to retract that liver. It was the best. And there was

562
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,800
generally a medical student in there as well. And again, if the medical student wants to go into

563
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,440
surgery, it's just going to be a fun afternoon if they're competent because they're going to get

564
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,520
pimped. So I don't know if the word pimping is still, is that still legal? Oh yeah. Pimping is

565
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,480
alive and well. Okay. Okay. Can you explain what pimping is? It's the Socratic method of teaching.

566
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:55,160
It's really posing a question. And so it's just a method of explaining things, but the students

567
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,760
perceive they've been taking tests their entire life on average, every four days of a human being's

568
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,160
existence before they come into medical school, they've been taking a test. So they perceive it

569
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:11,640
as, Oh my gosh, the great John Cameron or whoever the surgeon is, yo, Lilimo is asking me

570
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,960
a test question and I'm cataloging through the billions of things I've memorized to see if I

571
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,560
know the answer. And if I do, I will make it. And if I don't, I'm dead. We're more interested in

572
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,920
someone's communication skills, honesty, affability than we are. They know every fact and some of this

573
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,760
stuff is not knowable. Anyway, pimping is alive and well. Now the term still exists because it

574
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,320
was a very important part of what was happening. And you thought a lot about this. You knew any day

575
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,600
you went in the OR, okay, what are they going to pimp me on? Is it going to be the anatomy?

576
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,080
Is it going to be the history of this surgery? Is it going to be what the next step is? That kind

577
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,560
of thing. I personally don't do it after somebody passed out and I asked them a question once.

578
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,000
Normally they're shaking as you're asking them a question and you need their hands to be steady.

579
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,240
So I've basically asked myself the question. If I were to ask myself so and so, I would think it's,

580
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,720
so anyway. Well, I'll tell you, I thought there were some attendings who pimped purely from the

581
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,800
standpoint of just trying to torture. Cameron was not one of them. No. And Cameron, I actually

582
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,960
talked about this with Ted Shafer on my interview with him. Cameron did this thing called Sunday

583
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,200
School with us interns every morning. It's like seven o'clock every Sunday morning we did Sunday

584
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,720
School with Cameron where we would have these discussions about the history of surgery. And

585
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,280
for those of us who came to Hopkins with that sort of love, this was a gift from God. Like you couldn't

586
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,480
imagine you were getting to sit down with the most famous surgeon in the country and one of the

587
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,600
greatest historians of surgery and get this lesson. So to be in the OR with him was usually a history

588
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,960
lesson. Yeah. Okay. So fast forward. I'm an intern on GI Gold, which was the flagship service at

589
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,920
Hopkins. And we had a medical student. You always have two medical students. And as I said, usually

590
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,000
the medical students at Hopkins, because they're just so good that it's just, it's fun to have them

591
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,760
around. Even if they don't want to go into surgery, they're just good students and you get to know them

592
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,040
and stuff. So I became friends with many of the students. And in this particular month, one of the

593
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,920
students wanted to go into neurosurgery. Well, she's at the right place. We're at Hopkins, but you

594
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,280
knew deep down that it wasn't going to happen. She just was a space cadet. Like there was just no

595
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,560
other way to describe it. She was out to lunch, actually. The problem is she didn't know it.

596
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,000
She had this incredible confidence about her that did not match her ability. That's the most

597
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,720
dangerous subtype. It really is. So we're in the OR one day and Dr. Cameron is always talking to

598
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,800
the medical student. He's always being friendly. And he says, I do remember her name, but I won't

599
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,480
use it. So let's pretend her name is Susie. He's like, Susie, what are you interested in? And again,

600
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,120
this is where any medical student will say, oh, I'm interested in pediatrics. Great. And he will

601
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:48,040
march down the path of, do you know who the first pediatrician was? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

602
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,240
And he's just walking you down the path. And so Susie says, I'm interested in neurosurgery.

603
00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:02,280
And he's like, great. Do you know who the first neurosurgeon was at Johns Hopkins? And she's like,

604
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,520
no. Now the listener, if someone's listening to this, they're thinking, oh my God, how would you

605
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,600
know that? But here's the deal. If you're at Hopkins, you know this stuff. Just as you know,

606
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,720
William Osler and William Stuart Hallstead, who they were like, everybody knows who created

607
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,280
neurosurgery. There was a guy named Harvey Cushing. And he trained under Hallstead in the late 1800s

608
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,680
before moving to Boston and basically creating the field of modern neurosurgery. Yeah, the Cushing

609
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,200
Reflex. Right. If you're listening to this and you're not in medicine, you'd be like, why should

610
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,520
she have known this? But if you're in medicine, you realize you can't be at Hopkins and not know

611
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,160
this. Okay. So she doesn't know the answer. So he keeps trying to give her a hint. He's like,

612
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:49,240
well, he trained at Hopkins under Hallstead in the 1880s. No, I don't know. He then went up to

613
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,120
Boston and created this pro. No, I don't know. And by the way, at the time, Dr. Cameron is holding

614
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,360
the Bovii, which is, this is called the electrocottery, but everyone just calls it a Bovii. And

615
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,680
this is a device that revolutionized surgery. It's hard to imagine you could do surgery without

616
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,840
electrocottery. So this is a device that cuts and simultaneously cauterizes. So almost everything

617
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,040
we're doing in surgery is using this device. And it was invented by, of course, Cushing. And so as

618
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,440
he's holding the Bovii, and he's starting to get a little irked now that she doesn't even have a clue.

619
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:28,200
And he says, he invented the device I'm holding in. And he rattles off whatever year it was.

620
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:36,040
1907. No idea. No idea. He must have rattled off 10 other hints. She finally blurts out her best

621
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,800
answer. Ben Carson, who at the time was a pediatric neurosurgeon at Hopkins, who of course has since

622
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:49,080
gone on to become involved in politics. And he loses it. He's like, I suggest you learn your

623
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:55,640
history of neurosurgery. I couldn't wait to get out of the OR that day to tell my other co-intern

624
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:02,440
this story. And this is how deprived you are of any sense of whatever. We thought this was so

625
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:10,120
funny that we spent the next few months referring to Ben Carson as Benjamin Beauvoir de Carcin.

626
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,080
Because we came up with this idea that Ben Carson had actually invented the Bovii. And that's why

627
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,760
it took his name, but we had to come up with this whole French twist to make Beauvoir. So 20 other

628
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,400
residents at Hopkins heard this story and we were all going on about how Benjamin Beauvoir

629
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,080
de Carcin created the Bovii. And it wasn't cushing and all of this other stuff. And to me,

630
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,960
that's just an example. Like I don't even know why I told that story other than it just, you're so

631
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:42,120
sleep deprived. You're so getting, you're under so much stress that you have to latch onto the

632
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,920
dumbest thing as something that's funny. Yeah, absolutely. And it's like whatever it takes to

633
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,120
appease the higher ups, this sort of deep sarcasm. I've been the subject of it many

634
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:58,840
times with Dr. Cameron. I have a very good, strong, complicated relationship with the man. He's my

635
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:04,920
senior partner. We've shared a secretary and our practice now for my entire career since I was a

636
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:11,320
fellow under him. And he's both my best friend. I play golf with them maybe every other week or

637
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,880
great friends. We've done vacations together. The man's 82 years old and a legend in the field. And

638
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,160
at the same time, he's my greatest adversary in some of the innovation I've been trying to do at

639
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,920
Hopkins, mainly introduce minimally invasive pancreatic surgery. Now he's been very supportive

640
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:35,480
at times. At other times, he'll look at me with the suspicion of, are you using those toys again?

641
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,440
Heaven forbid we have a single complication, even though the baseline complication rate from pancreas

642
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,400
surgery is 20%. It's unavoidable if you do a fair amount. If I have one complication and we had,

643
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,120
did you use those sticks and toys and cameras? Yes, Dr. Cameron, we use the minimally invasive

644
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,880
to have less surgical stress on the patient's physiology and nearly eliminate the risk of a

645
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,640
wound infection and other complications. And he will say, well, next time you might as well just

646
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:12,280
take that patient and roll them into an empty elevator shaft. You know, or he'll call you an

647
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,200
assassin or what was the other one he used to say, Marty M&M conference. Sometimes I wonder,

648
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:27,640
whose team are you on the patients or the cancers? We'd be like, no, the gas does not spread the

649
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,600
cancer inflating the CO2 gas. And that was an old criticism that I've answered thousands of

650
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:37,560
questions about, I heard the gas spreads the cancer. No, that's not true. It's like lunar

651
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,440
eclipse can spread the cancer. I do want to go back to something else you said we sort of glossed

652
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,240
over it. And but before we get onto the sort of price stuff, which is it's so frustrating to me.

653
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,960
Two things. One is you're absolutely correct. And I've never really thought of it as explicitly as

654
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:59,240
you described it. But the idea that the doctors, nurses and healthcare providers who are involved

655
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:07,720
in seeing bad outcomes, it's a form of PTSD. Now, it's absolutely not as severe as a person whose

656
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,760
job it is to diffuse roadside bombs. And I don't think that anything we would ever see in the

657
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,160
hospital on our worst day comes close to what you're going to see in the battlefield. But

658
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,360
it is still PTSD. Yeah. And you bring it home. And I think of all of the weird rituals I used to have.

659
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,640
And I don't think I mean, I maybe told this story once, but we saw a lot of gunshot wounds. And

660
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,000
sometimes the patients die in the field, so you never see them. And then sometimes they come in

661
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,680
and you'd get to do these heroic things and they you save them. But there's a subset who die in the

662
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,880
trauma bay. There's quite a few of them. And I don't know why, but I couldn't sort of let that go.

663
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:48,040
And I remember distinctly one case of this guy who looked like he was about 25, single gunshot wound

664
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,440
to the head, but he must have had some vital signs in the field. So he was still brought in the trauma

665
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,120
bay. And I might have actually been the intern at this point. I don't think I was the Halstead

666
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,640
chief. So we're doing the few things that we can do to basically try to at least see if he has some

667
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:06,360
vital signs so we can do something. And but very quickly, it's clear that nothing's going to happen.

668
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,720
So we don't even bother to call neurosurgery. I think at this point he's just declared dead. And

669
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,680
at this point, everybody just has to sort of leave the trauma bay quickly so that the cleaning staff

670
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:20,200
can come in, body can be put into a bag, get all the blood off the floor, open the trauma bay up

671
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:26,840
for the next one. And his wallet is on the floor. And nobody else is in there except one of the

672
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:33,320
nurses. And I pick up the wallet and I open it up and there's his driver's license. And I look at

673
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,880
the picture and you can see what he looks like when he doesn't have a gunshot wound in his head.

674
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,200
Looks good, I bet. Yeah. Then there's a picture of a girl in his wallet and she looks like she's

675
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:49,400
about three years old. And I'm guessing it's his daughter and I'm thinking to myself, I realize

676
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,920
this guy is involved in something to do with drugs because 95% of the trauma we saw was drug

677
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,960
related. And it's so easy to just dismiss that as well. Now that's what's going to happen. If

678
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,920
you're going to sell and buy drugs in the streets of Baltimore, you're going to get shot once in a

679
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,240
while. And I have no attachment to this. But I looked at that. I look over at him and his brain

680
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,600
is coming out of the side of his head. And that's unfortunately just the reality of what a gunshot

681
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,320
wound to the head looks like. And I'm looking at this picture and I'm just torn up by it because

682
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,360
I'm thinking this is one more kid that doesn't have a dad. Whatever this guy did, he didn't

683
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:25,640
deserve this. Whether he stole something or didn't pay somebody or whatever he did, this was too

684
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:30,120
extreme a punishment. But then I also realized like whoever did this to him is also in the same

685
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:36,680
situation. This is just one horrible situation and it just killed me. It's hard to explain how

686
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,760
upset I was about this. But I also realized you have about 10 seconds to get your stuff together

687
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,560
and get on to the next one because you're going to get paged again and again and again. And oh,

688
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,720
by the way, you've got seven other things you didn't do yet on your list today that you have

689
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,720
to go and do. And you've got to go track down those blood culture results. There just wasn't

690
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:01,640
a moment to stop and do this. And I thought to myself, we saw so much trauma. And I don't mean

691
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:08,600
just trauma literally as in trauma, but I mean things that are traumatic to a human. And yet,

692
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:15,080
I don't once remember there being a discussion about that and how one should deal with that.

693
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,560
And I do think that so much of the burnout that we see and my friend Z-dog, who I know you've met

694
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:26,280
briefly, but hilarious. Yeah, you guys should spend a lot of time together. He's spoken about

695
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,200
this so eloquently, but this idea of physician burnout, he calls it sort of mortal wounding. And

696
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,960
I think he's right. This isn't, I'm tired of my job. It's, I don't know how to internalize

697
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:45,000
what I'm seeing. And we're just, I don't think as a society, whether it be in the military or in

698
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,680
medicine or in any field, we're just not, I don't know, we're not coached. We're not encouraged.

699
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:56,440
We're not taught how to share that. I mean, it would never make sense to me to talk to that,

700
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,520
to talk with anybody else about that, including my peers. Because why would I bother you with that

701
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,240
story? Because you've got 10 of the same story and you never think that, well, maybe there's value in

702
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,040
talking about that. And by the way, acknowledging how much it tears you up. Yeah. And it's exhausting

703
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:18,280
to allow your emotions to go there and think about that patient's daughter and what's happening with

704
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:24,840
the family. And should I reach out to a family member? You know, there's a nurse saying at the

705
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,800
nurses station, we have the family on the line. And you're thinking, I don't want to take that call

706
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:35,320
because it's emotionally exhausting. And you're already exhausted. You haven't slept for the love

707
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:42,520
of humanity in 36 hours. You got to prepare for the next one. So as a coping mechanism, by default,

708
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:49,160
without any outside instruction, a human being in that situation will naturally turn into a robot.

709
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,200
You just become androgynous. You do not express any emotions. You basically say,

710
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:59,640
this is part of the job and I've got to move on. But what happens is it changes who we are. And you

711
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,240
see these incredibly bright young people interview for med school, the sort of kid in college that

712
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,400
says, when everyone's talking about their careers, I'm kind of thinking about med school. They're

713
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,040
different from their peers, right? There's this intense sense of compassion, a desire to apply

714
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,800
science to help people. It's a compassion driven profession. The sort of person in high school

715
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,560
says, you know, I'm thinking about nursing, they're different from their peers. We're all driven to

716
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,440
medicine because of a sense of compassion. And then you take these students when they interview

717
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,960
for medical school at Johns Hopkins, and we ask them the standard question, everybody gets asked

718
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,960
in every medical school interview, why do you want to be a doctor? Because I really want to help

719
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,720
people. And 90% of people will say they want to go into medicine to become a missionary doctor or to

720
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:52,680
help the poor or underserved in some capacity, if not full time as part of their job as a part time

721
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:59,640
co-career. I didn't realize it was that high. 90% of people starting out have some desire to serve

722
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,880
underserved, underprivileged people in some capacity. Exactly. They're not coming in saying,

723
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,280
I want to be an orthopedic knee surgeon and we need good orthopedic knee surgeons, but they come in.

724
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,400
Which you can still do in an underserved capacity. It was basically less than 10% of people have a

725
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,640
very clear sense in their mind that they want to do the most elite or whatever thing. And yeah,

726
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,240
they're coming in open-minded. They want to do some good. I mean, especially nowadays,

727
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,360
the millennials are coming in with this social justice mentality. I mean, when you interviewed

728
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,680
for med school, I said it, let me ask you, how did you answer that question? Did you have? I don't

729
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,560
know that I was asked that explicitly. When I went to medical school, I wanted to be a pediatric

730
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:39,880
oncologist and I had been sort of very moved by an experience that I had seen of a child dying of

731
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:45,000
leukemia whose name I still remember when I was in college. It's funny. It's a funny story,

732
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,760
actually. I interviewed with a surgeon at Stanford, an ENT surgeon, and you sort of get this random

733
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,200
draw. Like you get a medical student that's going to interview you in three faculty. And I don't

734
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:59,080
remember who the other two faculty were, but this one guy interviewed me. He was sort of a big shot

735
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,320
ENT surgeon. And when he went down this path of what do you want to do? And I said, pediatric

736
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,600
oncology. He spent the entire interview trying to talk me out of it. Classic. He's like, what,

737
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,240
what are you talking about? Do you have any idea how hard that is? I mean, are you crazy?

738
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,800
Like, are you a glutton for punishment? You want to watch kids die of cancer? Let me tell you

739
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,440
something, kid. You do not want to do that. All right. You want to be a surgeon. You want to,

740
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,520
and he just rattled off all these other things you would do, but you do not under any circumstance

741
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:33,400
want to go into pediatric oncology. And I was like, okay. Okay. It's impressive. I mean,

742
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,520
first of all, that is probably the most admirable area of medicine people can go into. I think

743
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:44,200
pediatrics and psychiatry are probably the most impressive and honorable subfields of medicine

744
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:50,200
people go into. And of that, say cancer care in children, it's just, I really admire those folks.

745
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,960
But there is something to be said for what he pointed out that I couldn't appreciate at the

746
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:59,720
time. And so as much as I can mock that story, when you don't have kids, there's something you're

747
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:05,080
missing in that equation. I couldn't do pediatric oncology today if my life depended on it, because

748
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,080
I think as a doctor, you're sort of always putting yourself a little bit in that person's shoes

749
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,720
that sitting across from you. That's what empathy means. And if we're doing our job correctly,

750
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,120
we have to have empathy. So you have to be able to look at the world through their lens.

751
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:26,600
The problem is once you have children, you look at the parent of someone whose child you're taking

752
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,760
care of who has cancer. And I don't think I could do, I mean, I know that I have kids, there are a

753
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,560
lot of things I could take in life, but losing a child, I don't think I could take. And so maybe he

754
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:41,000
probably had kids and maybe he understood without being able to articulate why, maybe he understood,

755
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,480
are you crazy? It takes a superhuman to do anything in that space. And I remember my time in this sort

756
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,120
of pediatric oncology world, as you said, it's a very special nurse, respiratory therapist,

757
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:58,280
physical therapist, physician, everyone who was involved in that care, that's a different cloth

758
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,320
those people are cut from. Yeah, it's very impressive. We take people when they come in

759
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:12,520
with these very altruistic goals in life. And you look at them fast forward eight or 10 years later,

760
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:18,680
and they're like different people. They are, all of a sudden, we beat them down, we make them memorize

761
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:24,520
and regurgitate the urea cycle and the Krebs cycle 18 times, even though no one's ever needed to know

762
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,400
the intermediary of the Krebs cycle on the fly in the hospital, right? It's just this absurd,

763
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:37,400
this entire medical education is just so absurd. And I loved in the Price We Pay book, highlighting

764
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:42,360
what's happening now with some of the innovative education, Jefferson, for example, the dean there

765
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:47,560
saying we're going to hire based on empathy and compassion and self-awareness. And yeah, we'll

766
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,240
teach you what you need to know, you'll know the vocabulary, we're going to teach you the life

767
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:56,200
skills that you need to know, we're going to teach you how to communicate, how to find knowledge when

768
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,760
you don't know it, how to be honest and say I don't know when you need to say that. So I love

769
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,920
learning about this new approach to education. But there's, there's this thing that we've been

770
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,560
doing where we take these highly creative and talented altruistic people, I mean, they look

771
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,760
beautiful when they're in the lobby of the Ross building waiting for their interview, their hair

772
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,720
is combed perfectly, they're wearing these suits or dresses that are just dressed to the nine.

773
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:27,080
And they say all the things that show that they are 100% in to help people, they're mega athletes,

774
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:32,280
they've run immunization programs in Nicaragua, right? They're the most creative, beautiful,

775
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:38,360
awesome souls in the world, and they come in. And then we beat them down with this Eurea cycle,

776
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:44,200
Krebs cycle regurgitation treadmill. And in residency, don't ask questions and internalize

777
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,360
all this crap that you're going to see. That's stuff that isn't right. Is this still happening

778
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,880
though? It's happening. I mean, I was just talking to one of our medical students about it, and they

779
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,520
were talking about how a lot of it's the accreditation boards and the examiners. These are

780
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:01,320
not your millennials writing the boards. These are folks saying you have to know how to refract

781
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,280
somebody for glasses, even though you're becoming a urologist. It's important information for you to

782
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:11,640
know, ophthalmology, it's just territorial. So they come out and eight to 10 years later,

783
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,880
look at them, their hair is all messed up. They're wearing pajamas. They don't have a business card.

784
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,480
If you ask them, where's your office? They say, I don't know. They feel humiliated,

785
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:26,200
belittled, subjected to all this beating. And we wonder why they feel entitled. And we wonder why

786
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:31,320
they feel why they're doing stuff they know they shouldn't be doing. We wonder why a doctor in a

787
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:37,160
primary care clinic is giving out antibiotics too frequently. Or 10 years ago, we prescribed as

788
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:43,560
physicians in the United States 2.4 billion prescriptions. Last year it had hit 5.4 billion.

789
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,920
Did disease double in the last 10 years? No, we have a crisis of appropriateness. To memorize

790
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,520
everything in medicine, it's pairs, diagnosis, treatment, diagnosis, treatment. That's the only

791
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:58,040
way you can memorize the thousands of things we have to regurgitate. So you develop these reflexes.

792
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,720
Gout is a condition where the big toe has pain at the joint from crystals. You treat it with

793
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,720
colchicine. And you memorize these pairs. And what you lose is the sense of the threshold of

794
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:15,000
treatment or the appropriateness of care. What comes out are these doctors that are entitled

795
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,320
sometimes, burnout, we beat them down, they're speaking a different language that has its own

796
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,440
value system. No, this is not everybody. I mean, this is the sort of risk or the hazard along the

797
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,880
path. To me, I think of the exceptions. I think of Chris Sonenday. He's to me the most special,

798
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,880
one of the most special residents I ever knew. I don't know. I always looked at Chris and thought,

799
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,400
and Chris, by the way, is he's now running the transplant program at the University of Michigan,

800
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,640
but there was just something about that guy. Emotionally vulnerable. Yeah. And maintained

801
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:48,440
his humanity under any circumstance. And always, I guess I've never met a human in the context of

802
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,920
medicine and I've met some amazing people, but it's hard to say like you've met one person who took

803
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,960
everything that you would want to be able to do to the highest level. Yeah. So I always wonder,

804
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,680
why couldn't everybody, myself included, that is, be like Chris? I mean, it's hard. I mean,

805
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:07,480
you're one of the most disciplined people I've ever known in my life, but it's hard not to get

806
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:12,200
beaten down. Oh man, I was so jaded. That's the beauty of someone like Chris. And you never really

807
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:17,560
got jaded either. I mean, you were also in this group of people who just never, because you pointed

808
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,880
this out yesterday when we were having dinner, it came up. It's like most of us, when we become jaded,

809
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:30,520
become sarcastic. That became our coping tool of, we just became sort of snarky, sarcastic bastards.

810
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:37,000
Coping tool. Yeah. Coping tool. I mean, I remember my first day in the clinics in medical school,

811
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I was assigned a primary care office and I was working with a doc who's an internal medicine doc.

812
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:49,320
I show up a little early and he says, the charts are in the door. Here's the schedule. Feel free to

813
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,440
just go in and see the patient. And I go in to see the first patient at eight o'clock and there's

814
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,840
a 15 minute slot and they're getting into all these deep issues and they're asking me about

815
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,600
medication interactions. And I'm thinking, I think there's an interaction there. I got to look it up

816
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,920
and basically I leave the patient with, I'm going to get back to you. There's a lot of stuff here

817
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:11,720
to unpack. And then I go to the next patient at eight, 15 and then the next patient at eight,

818
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,760
30 and four patients in the hour. And each one, I feel like I gave kind of a half bait. And it's

819
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,800
like, this is insane. And I stopped at nine o'clock and I looked at the head doctor and I said,

820
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,360
I know I'm giving you brief presentations here for a minute. You're going in for a minute and

821
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,200
then we're treatment plan and a minute of documenting and I get 10 minutes with the,

822
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:36,600
by the way, are we going like this till five o'clock? Because like I'm dead or an hour into

823
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:42,520
this and this is crazy. He's like, Oh yeah. Yeah. And you do this every day. He's like,

824
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,640
well, I do it four days a week and I have an administrative day. Like how are you not going

825
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:53,000
bananas? How would you possibly manage this? He's like, well, you know, you get comfortable

826
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,680
with certain diagnoses. The reality is show me somebody in America today who's practicing

827
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:03,480
office-based high volume medicine, who's not burnout. I mean, it's probably, I don't know,

828
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:08,600
20, 30%, but you talk to folks. I was talking to an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine

829
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:14,040
at the Brigham when I was visiting and we met and she said, I just came back from clinic,

830
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,760
endocrinology clinic. And I said, Oh, how was it? And she's like, I only do it one day

831
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,280
every two weeks or something. Cause I'm working for the New England Journal of Medicine,

832
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,400
but it's clear to me, everybody there is burnout. I'm like, how could you not be burnout office

833
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,080
based medicine? I mean, what's the solution to this? We have a population that seems to be

834
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,880
getting sicker and that's not medicine's fault. There's lots of blame. You could point at maybe

835
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,640
why we're getting sicker, but there's no doubt about it. I mean, people are getting more and

836
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:49,240
more sick with chronic diseases and they're going to come to the healthcare system to get cared for.

837
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,840
Again, I don't have the insight you do into what those volumes look like and to how many of those

838
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,880
patients are being treated as outpatients and things like that. But how do we take care of

839
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:05,720
people? How is there enough time in the day to have enough doctors to take care of these folks

840
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,200
because what you described sounds horrible. I can't imagine if I only had 15 minutes to see it.

841
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:17,240
I get angry at my office staff if they give me less than two hour blocks between patients.

842
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:21,800
Once in a while they'll stack them one hour apart and I'll get upset. Be like, guys,

843
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:26,520
are you joking? We have to spend the first 30 minutes just catching up before we even talk about

844
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,560
the labs. So what you're describing seems so foreign to me, but at the same time I'm empathetic

845
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,760
because I realize that's the nature of patient volume. So how does one fix this? By the way,

846
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:42,600
it's horrible on both ends. Patients don't like it either. What I've discovered is doctors were able,

847
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,960
so first of all, I personally believe that doctors are not lazy people. We just don't want to spend

848
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,920
our time on things that don't matter. And there's an incredible amount of shit that's just been

849
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:58,280
thrown at doctors in the last several years that has nothing to do with patient care. And I know

850
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,600
you've talked about some of that in some of your other episodes. But the most exciting thing,

851
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,240
and I'll tell you in writing about these issues, be it medical education or pricing failures or

852
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:13,400
overtreatment or primary care in the book, the price we pay, one thing I wanted to do is balance

853
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,600
every problem with a solution or exciting disruptor because right now I am so optimistic and up on

854
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,000
the future of healthcare. So many cool things are happening. They're mostly the young folks,

855
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,920
mostly people that have very little tolerance for BS. The globally capitated primary care clinics

856
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,480
are freaking awesome. Okay, so let's explain to people what all of those words mean and start with

857
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:39,160
what is capitated? So basically, there's no billing going on because globally capitated means that the

858
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:45,080
clinic as a whole, the organization is getting paid a lump sum amount of money. So they don't have to

859
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,640
worry about billing for every little thing. And they can spend as much time as they want with

860
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:55,560
patients because they are evaluated by the outcomes of those patients long term. What percent

861
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,920
of their patients use an emergency room multiple times or get readmitted to a hospital after

862
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,040
discharge or the rates of certain health complications in a population long term.

863
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:11,960
There's an exciting one in Florida called ChenMed and the Chen family is an incredible group of

864
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:18,600
doctors, a father and two sons, both of whom are primary care physicians. And they have made a deal

865
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:25,400
with insurance and employers where they've said, look, pay us a lump sum for the entire journey of

866
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:31,400
care of your beneficiaries, your population, your employees. And we will assume the downstream risk.

867
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,120
And if you do enough, if you have enough patients, you can assume that risk. So if your patient goes

868
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:41,720
on to surgery, it's sort of counted that money is sort of counted against the amount that you've been

869
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:47,400
allocated for that patient. So what it's done is it's created this incredible incentive because

870
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:54,280
the primary care physician assumes and takes the downstream financial burden of the care.

871
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,960
It creates this incredible alignment of incentives long term to do what's in the best interest of the

872
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,440
patient and docs know what's in the best interest of the patient. It's exactly what you're doing. It's

873
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,200
spending time. It's being able to go to the home or send somebody to the home. And they hire these

874
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:17,800
patient navigators, at least Iora does this. And the navigators will visit the home to figure out

875
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,360
why aren't they taking their medications or what's in their refrigerator or what do they want to talk

876
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,400
about or what's their activity challenge here. But this is different. The only example that people

877
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,480
would think of today on a massive scale of capitation would be Kaiser Permanente. If you're

878
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,640
on the West Coast, is there any other large capitated system in the country? I'm a big fan

879
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:42,200
of Oak Street, Iora, ChenMed. There's the Magenta clinics. These are smaller. They're probably doing

880
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:48,760
much more than what one of these huge cap systems are doing, right? Exactly. Is there a critical mass

881
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,800
at which from an actuarial standpoint to manage risk you have to have a certain number of patients

882
01:17:53,800 --> 01:18:00,200
in a pool to justify what, for example, the Chen family are doing? Because if I'm putting my sort

883
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:04,360
of risk mitigation hat on, that's a dangerous proposition for the physician. They could get

884
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:10,280
wiped out. If you have a small enough pool, one bad outcome, which can be entirely out of your

885
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:15,080
hands, patients walking down the street, they get hit by a car or patient gets cancer. I mean,

886
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,080
this is going to happen despite all of your best efforts in prevention. If that counts against your

887
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,160
cap, you're done. So what's the number? Do you need like a thousand patients at a minimum to be able to?

888
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,880
Five hundred has been the number that's been floated out there in the actuarial science for

889
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:34,040
when it's worthwhile to self-fund a population. So in other words, if you're Apple and you've got

890
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:40,200
giant cash reserves, why do you need insurance? You can just process the bills yourself. With a

891
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:46,280
three percent overhead, you hire like a bill claims processing company. So right now, Apple,

892
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,560
I don't know who their ASO is, but Apple goes to Blue Shield and says, we're going to pay you

893
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:58,040
X dollars to administratively manage, but we manage the risk. Yes. We hold the risk. We are paying

894
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,560
for the cost. And what does that work out to? Maybe you don't know Apple's numbers,

895
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:09,480
but if you pick a company that for whom you know the data, what is the cost per life that is

896
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,560
typically paid for by a large employer in the United States today? Average, it might be seven

897
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:20,520
thousand dollars. And with there being a financial benefit to self-funding or what we call self-insuring,

898
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:26,120
it's usually just below that once you self-fund. So at the point of 500 employees or more,

899
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:32,360
the vast majority of businesses in the United States have recently moved to self-funding.

900
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:40,600
It's like, this seems crazy. I obviously my company is very small, so we're not self-insured. We pay

901
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,920
an insurance company to take the risk. We pay way more than seven thousand dollars per person

902
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,200
per year. Yeah. Traditional insurance usually is more expensive. Now it's regional and it's based

903
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:57,800
on the age of the employees and whether or not families are covered. But per person, that's

904
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,160
generally the average expenditure in a self-funded plan. Now there's many variations. So a lot of

905
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,640
businesses, let's say a business of your size, might say we're going to take out stop loss coverage.

906
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:12,840
So if anybody gets one of these giant bills over a hundred thousand dollars, that stop loss plan

907
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,880
will kick in. There's 21 stop loss insurance companies in the U.S. They sell across state

908
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:23,000
lines. It's very competitive. It works beautifully. And businesses are saying, look, we'll assume the

909
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,320
first hundred thousand dollars of risk. A lot of businesses can afford that risk, especially if

910
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,400
they're saving money on the front end. And if they have a large enough patient population that they

911
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,600
can spread that risk out. Yeah, exactly. This is the future of healthcare and what's happening

912
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,240
pretty soon. And the reason I'm so excited about healthcare is that doctors, primary care doctors

913
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,640
are saying, let me help you. Let me move in. I want to be the doc for your company. I want to

914
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:51,240
go over the occupational hazards on the factory assembly line. I want to talk about prevention

915
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:56,200
and doing stuff immediately so that patients don't need to go to the emergency room. They can come to

916
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,520
me for urgent care. Then I'll sort of figure out. And the utilization is down. The costs are down

917
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:05,080
because if there's one story of a modern American medicine, it's that price gouging has become an

918
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,120
accepted way of doing business in certain pockets of healthcare. And as a business, you're very

919
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:15,240
vulnerable. Okay. So now I want to dive into this quickly, but to do it, we have to set the stage for

920
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,200
the listener. So I want to tell a story and then I want to talk some numbers. Here's the story.

921
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,640
When I left medicine, the first thing I went and did is worked at a consulting firm. And what I

922
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,040
got involved in just based on my background was on credit risk. When I left medicine, I really left

923
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:33,880
medicine. So I'm now a model spreadsheet jockey and we're working on something called the Basel 2

924
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:40,920
Accord, which then turned into two years leading up to the mortgage meltdown. I was part of a team

925
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:47,080
that was basically now in the business of predicting how bad that was going to be. And

926
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:53,080
then once it became clear, it was going to be a catastrophe, figuring out how would you stem that

927
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:58,680
tide? By the end of two years of that stuff, I actually understood pretty much everything one

928
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:06,440
could understand about mortgage backed securities and all of the ridiculous financial tools that

929
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,280
were very eloquently described in the movie, The Big Short. Yeah. Now look, you can watch The Big

930
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:16,120
Short and in two hours, I think understand frankly, 70% of it, but I spent two years knee deep in it.

931
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:21,800
And I understand 95% of it by the end of it. If you gave me another three years and said, Peter,

932
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:27,240
I want you to devote yourself to this study of the US healthcare system. And at the end of that,

933
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,960
three years, I want you to explain it to me as clearly as you could today explain to me how

934
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,400
mortgages work, how they're securitized, packaged, credit default swaps, all of these things and how

935
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,760
it led to a calamity. I wouldn't be able to do it. And I can tell you this because over the past 10

936
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:50,200
years, I have tried to understand it over the past 13 years actually. And I can't even fully

937
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,920
give you the profit and loss statement of the US healthcare system. Now, I don't think I'm the

938
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:59,720
smartest guy in the world, but I'm also not the dumbest guy in the world. And that drives me

939
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:09,640
bananas that all I see is a black box for which over $3 trillion goes in and $3 trillion gets

940
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:17,800
pulled out. I don't understand how we can fix something when most people can't even wrap their

941
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,920
heads around what's happening. It's incredibly frustrating, especially when you master a certain

942
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:29,720
domain of medicine to be able to have no understanding about this gigantic industry

943
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,680
that you're in the midst of. People came up to doctors all the time during the health reform

944
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,240
debates and said, what do you think? And the reality is, have we ever really talked about

945
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,520
how we finance health insurance or whether or not Dr. Pei gets pulled out of nursing home

946
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:51,400
payment allocations? We've basically been focused on two issues in terms of our doctor's groups,

947
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:59,720
Dr. Pei and malpractice reform, which is a whole other subject we talk. The Big Short beautifully

948
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:05,480
explained that no, it's not a credit default swap. It's so complicated that nobody can understand,

949
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:10,600
leave it to us experts. It's actually pretty simple. It's just a way around insurance to do that.

950
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:17,320
It's spending money you don't have. So what I wanted to do is in the book, the price we pay,

951
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:23,800
create the Big Short for health care to explain things in a way that are understandable,

952
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:29,800
relatable, and that touch on every area of health care. And basically because there is no silver

953
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:37,720
bullet in health care, as you're alluding to, it requires a brief moment understanding pricing

954
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:44,440
failures, a moment understanding the overtreatment crisis that we've created, and a moment understanding

955
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:50,680
middleman and administrative waste. And if we can tackle each of those subjects in one book in a

956
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:56,360
way that people can walk away and say, oh, now I understand how a PBM or a pharmacy benefit

957
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:02,280
manager works. I try to give an example explaining it like somebody selling Girl Scout cookies and

958
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:07,080
how the money flows. All right. So use that example because PBM's, I think, I mean, it took me two

959
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:12,920
years to understand what a PBM did. Again, I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed. No. It

960
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,080
annoys me that it took me two years to actually understand how PBM's worked. So explain it using

961
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:23,480
this Girl Scout example. So let's say that a mom comes to your business and says, I'd like to be

962
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:29,960
the exclusive seller and provider of Girl Scout cookies to your employees. You say, okay, that

963
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:35,160
sounds good. I don't really know what Girl Scout cookies cost, but yeah, I'd like the idea of all

964
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:41,160
my employees having Girl Scout cookies. So this mom then brings in a bunch of kids who sell Girl

965
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:47,720
Scout cookies to the employees and the employees walk up and say, oh, how much is a box? Well, which

966
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:53,240
company do you work for? I work for this company. Okay. Then you just have to pay $3. Oh, because

967
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:58,280
this mom sells Girl Scout cookies to many companies. She's the exclusive provider of Girl Scout cookies

968
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:03,880
to more than one company. Yeah, but that's not why it costs $3. It costs $3 because that's just the

969
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:12,680
copay of what the employee's paying for the box. The mom then charges the employer 50 bucks per box

970
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,000
as the benefit. The employer's saying, oh great, thank you for providing Girl Scout cookies to my

971
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,440
employees. You have 50 bucks a box. I don't really know what they go for. Why don't they go for $5?

972
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:30,920
Sometimes in the real pharmacy benefit world, the employer is paying $6 a box of Girl Scout cookies,

973
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:37,000
which covers the entire cost and some profit. And then they are still billing the employer 40 bucks.

974
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,480
Now you would think the employers would say, this is complete bullshit. I know what you're up to.

975
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:48,360
I know those boxes are $5 a box. You're gouging me. Screw this. I'm going to get another pharmacy

976
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:54,200
benefit manager. I believe in competition. I want to put it out for bid. The problem is employers

977
01:26:54,200 --> 01:27:01,160
cannot understand the names of the drugs and the generic substitutes and the biosimilars and the

978
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:07,560
bioequivalence and the different dosing schedules and the different frequencies. So they literally

979
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:15,160
get a report at the end of a year with, let's say you have 1,000 employees of 4,000 medications

980
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:20,920
that you paid for as a self-funded or self-insured business. Which is different from saying there's

981
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:27,480
chocolate chip, there's Oreo cream, there's vanilla mint. With cookies, it's easier because

982
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:32,280
there's only like 10 flavors. Right. You can understand the market value. When you're doing

983
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:37,160
it with medications, there are so many games it's so hard to understand. I've talked to employers

984
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,080
when doing the research for the price we pay that they get these reports and they're like,

985
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,920
I don't know what the hell I'm spending money on. I can't understand this. And the brokers or the

986
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:54,760
PBMs say, look, you're getting bulk discounts. Okay. You're getting a 15% discount. And the

987
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:59,080
employers, they look at these shiny objects and think, okay, well, I guess. And then there are

988
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:05,800
all sorts of money games that they added on. Now, providing pharmacy benefits is a valuable service.

989
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,360
I believe businesses should make a profit. So they should make a profit for the service. But what

990
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,520
they've done is played a massive shell game with things that nobody can understand. Sometimes the

991
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,880
pharmacists themselves can't understand why when you pay out of pocket, when you go to GoodRx,

992
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,760
which is one of the apps I recommend people use when they need a prescription, go to GoodRx and

993
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:29,080
they'll tell you what the price of that drug is and all the places near you. Why is it that

994
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:34,200
that price is often below what your employer is being charged and it's sometimes even below what

995
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,040
your co-pay would be? Yeah, I did this actually recently. I had to pick something up. And so I'm

996
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:44,120
a big fan of GoodRx as well. We should make sure everybody knows to use that. I'm actually friends

997
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,680
with the guy who built the app. So I looked up what 30-day supply of this drug would cost if I

998
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:54,600
went to buy it in cash because I'm so annoyed with how high my insurance premiums are. I keep saying

999
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,720
to myself, why do I have health insurance? Like I'm not even sure I know anymore because the co-pays

1000
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:04,760
we get stuck with, I was telling you last night, I mean, I got an ambulance bill for $15,000 or

1001
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:11,800
something. It was just ridiculous. So I noticed that the cash price of 30 days of this drug was

1002
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:18,120
$227. That was fine. So I went to the pharmacy and I'd already paid for it with my insurance. So my

1003
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:24,600
co-pay was 30 bucks. But when I looked at the slip, I saw that my insurance company was charged

1004
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,520
almost $1,000. So there's a bit of a disconnect here. My insurance company, who's charging me

1005
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:39,240
a premium to take care of my family that is, I think, beyond absurd, is getting gouged. They just

1006
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:46,600
paid $970 for something that if I didn't have insurance, I would have paid $200 for. How does

1007
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:53,160
that happen? So one thing that has come up in the recent case of the insurance executive who got

1008
01:29:53,160 --> 01:30:01,720
charged $70,000 for a hip replacement, even though Medicare would pay $20,000 and the benchmark

1009
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:08,360
blue book price is $28,000 or $29,000. How did he get charged $70,000? Now, he didn't get charged

1010
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:14,840
directly. He was responsible for something like 20%, a 20% of that amount. He's an insurance

1011
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,040
executive or leader in the field of insurance actuarial science. And he basically said,

1012
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:25,400
who the heck negotiated this rate? It wasn't a sticker price. It was the negotiated price

1013
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,840
between his insurance company and one of the big hospitals in New York. Why wouldn't they

1014
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:36,920
negotiate a better rate? And the article basically suggested that it's not necessarily in the

1015
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:42,040
financial interests of all insurance companies in all areas to really negotiate the best rate.

1016
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:42,440
Why?

1017
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:46,920
Well, for a couple reasons. One, there's something called the medical loss ratio or the MLR that was

1018
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,320
instated with the Affordable Care Act that said that insurance companies can basically only have

1019
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:58,040
a profit, if you will, of 20%. That is, 80% of all the money they take in for insurance premiums

1020
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,640
has to be paid out as claims payouts.

1021
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:08,840
I mean, I understand that and I applaud the idea behind that. But to say that, well, let's just be

1022
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:14,120
completely wasteful with the resources to make sure we hit our MLR is crazy. Why not instead say,

1023
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:19,720
if you blow through your MLR, let's say your profit margin is 40% instead of 20%,

1024
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,800
just apply the extra 20% to next year's premium reduction.

1025
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:30,280
Well, if you can only make 20% of the premiums as profit, how do you make more profit the next year?

1026
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:37,000
Organizations like to make profit. You build in, you almost want more payouts and then build it

1027
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,080
into your premiums for next year. So the more they pay out, the more they can say, well,

1028
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,240
premiums are going up 12% next year. That gives them more money.

1029
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,560
I see. So you're saying they want to drive revenue as high as possible because they're

1030
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,080
only allowed to keep 20% of gross. Exactly. The higher the gross, the higher the profit.

1031
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,760
Yeah. Now, I don't think I know a lot of insurance executives. I don't think they're

1032
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:04,600
diabolical people. I have really asked how intentional is this or passive is it? And I've

1033
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:09,320
heard it's mixed. Some insurance markets are very competitive, but this was in New York City,

1034
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:15,480
one of the big hospitals charging 70 grand. So the insurance companies may not be your fiduciary,

1035
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:21,160
your independent. And if I can just take an aside for one second, one of my biggest frustrations

1036
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:26,840
is the lexicon or the language that we all use. Oh, not to criticize you, but I do this also.

1037
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:33,880
You referred to my insurance company paid that amount. Well, actually, you paid that amount in

1038
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:38,760
your insurance premiums. Oh, my employer paid the rest. Well, guess what? That's from the same pool

1039
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:44,600
of money of wages and benefits that you would otherwise get raised from. So this lexicon of,

1040
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:51,480
oh, my, the government paid. Well, we're paying what, a 7.5% Medicare excise tax on your end. And

1041
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:57,160
then if you're self-employed, double that. You're paying 15% Medicare excise tax because otherwise

1042
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:01,240
the employer is paying. Well, you're paying. It's the same pool. Oh, the government paid. Oh,

1043
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,880
Medicare paid. Oh, the insurance company paid. Oh, my employer paid. No, no, you pay. The joke

1044
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:12,680
is on us, right? You've paid in so many different ways. People say that healthcare is now 18% of

1045
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:20,360
the GDP and it may be as high as 16% of our federal expenditure, all of our tax dollars in

1046
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:27,000
Massachusetts. Guess what percent of all the state dollars go towards healthcare? 43%. I was

1047
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,880
going to guess 25. 43%. I just met with one of the recent legislators in Florida who's now in DC,

1048
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:40,200
working with us on price transparency advocacy. 43%. So people think, okay, 16% of the federal

1049
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:44,840
expenditure. Well, guess what? Guess where people are spending their social security checks.

1050
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:50,040
They're increasingly spending on those copays and deductibles. Are health-related costs still

1051
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:54,440
the leading cause of personal bankruptcy? Yeah, it's the number one cause of personal

1052
01:33:54,440 --> 01:34:03,160
bankruptcy and FICA scores getting ruined. And now tragically one in five Americans has medical debt

1053
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:09,160
in collections. What? One in five Americans has medical debt in collections. And that seems,

1054
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:15,640
I mean, not saying I don't believe you, that just seems hard to imagine. FICA scores are getting

1055
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:20,360
ruined. People are paying more for their mortgages because they had a surprise bill that

1056
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:25,560
was unpaid. People are getting hammered out there. And when we hear that healthcare was the number

1057
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:30,760
one issue in the midterm elections, it's really medical bills. People are angry. They feel they

1058
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,920
have no recourse. In some cases I discovered in the book, the hospitals take the patients to court

1059
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:43,000
and garnish their minimum wage or paycheck. There's a court in Virginia, an hour south of my house,

1060
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,640
where if you don't pay your bill to that community hospital, they will take you to court within

1061
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,360
months, garnish your wages. And if you don't have a job where you prefer not to have your wages

1062
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,400
garnish, the court will ask for your ABA number and your routing number and your bank account

1063
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:02,360
number. And the money will just get pulled right out of your savings from the hospital. Now these

1064
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,400
are in place. Is this hospital a for-profit or not-for-profit? It's a not-for-profit. It's a

1065
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:13,560
not-for-profit. And the for-profit, HCA has a hospital in town and they behave. They stay true

1066
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:19,000
to the mission of medicine. They don't shake people down that are poor. I mean, you can shake down

1067
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:24,440
a rich person who had plastic surgery and didn't pay their bill. I got no problem with you suing

1068
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,040
the socks off of that person. But that doesn't even happen because you pay up front for all of

1069
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:32,360
that stuff anyway, don't you? Yeah, exactly. That's sort of a non-issue. That's a non-issue. But these

1070
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:37,480
are low income. These are poor people who work and have health insurance. They've done nothing

1071
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:44,920
wrong. They've showed up to work. They work hard. I've met several of them who are single moms. I

1072
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:52,200
was in New Mexico visiting a hospital before the book I profile in for the hospital I profile in

1073
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:57,560
the book, We Price We Pay, where the hospital has sued half the town in New Mexico. The town only

1074
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,960
has like 28,000 people in it. They've sued half the town. The courthouse when I walk in there,

1075
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,160
the clerk says, that's all we're dealing with here is hospital lawsuits. I said, what percent of your

1076
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:13,000
civil cases in this courthouse in this town is the hospital suing patients to garnish their wages?

1077
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:19,080
So very low income blue collar towns, an oil town, mostly oil workers. And they said, oh, it's 95%

1078
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:24,280
of what we deal with. I said, how many in a day will you get? Oh, we could get 10 or 20 lawsuits

1079
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:29,480
in a day from the hospital. It's almost become like the court is now their collections department.

1080
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:35,960
And one woman, her car was in the shop for repairs. It cost 800 bucks. She didn't have the

1081
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:40,920
800 bucks to get it out of the shop. And then she gets hammered with a $4,000 bill for taking her

1082
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:46,680
kid in for an asthma treatment that took 45 minutes. People are getting hammered out there.

1083
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:52,280
And what we're saying, and what I'm trying to use this incredible platform that God's given me as a

1084
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:58,440
surgeon at Johns Hopkins is to say, this is not our heritage. This is not our profession.

1085
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:04,520
We have this incredible public trust. We need to stand up for our patients. I mean, just to take

1086
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,520
a step back from this, I don't think anybody listening to this right now thinks what you're

1087
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:14,280
describing is cool. I mean, this is totally unacceptable. The doctors think it's unacceptable.

1088
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:19,160
The patients think it's unacceptable, but the doctors and the patients aren't the ones that

1089
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:24,280
are making it happen. So you've got now two groups who are finding this unacceptable. One,

1090
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,160
because they're the ones actually getting gouged. That's the patient. And of course,

1091
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:31,320
and the physician who's saying, wait a minute, this just doesn't even seem right on first

1092
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:37,080
principles. But how do we do anything about it? I mean, it's very frustrating because I

1093
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:41,240
grew up in Canada. I think it's totally overblown when people in the United States romanticize

1094
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,520
Canada. Let me tell you something. Canada does not have a perfect healthcare system. So any of

1095
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,360
you listening to this, who think, oh, we should just be like Canada, be careful what you wish for.

1096
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:54,520
Because I could tell you 57 horror stories of what it's like to be a patient in Canada who

1097
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:00,680
tears their ACL and has to wait seven freaking months to get an MRI to confirm a diagnosis.

1098
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,040
And if you want to do anything else about it, good. Drive to Buffalo and pay out of pocket for your MRI

1099
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:12,040
and join the price gouging south of the border. So Canada is not a panacea either, but there is

1100
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:18,280
something in Canada and the UK and in other single payer systems that just makes sense.

1101
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:25,400
And it is the following. It is a budget, not a demand driven system. And a single payer always

1102
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:32,440
owns the risk for life. Those are in my humble opinion, two things that are sorely lacking here.

1103
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:37,880
I'll explain what those mean. I know you understand what that means. In the UK, NHS has a budget. The

1104
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,840
budget determines how much they're going to spend on healthcare that year. In the United States,

1105
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,800
we have a demand driven system. You can predict what we're going to spend next year on healthcare,

1106
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:54,600
but the reality of it is demand determines how much will get spent. The demand is set by the

1107
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,200
patient and the provider. A lot of the stuff you talk about, the over treatment, the unnecessary

1108
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:04,200
treatment. I want to dive into that by the way, because there's so many interesting ideas there.

1109
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,920
The second thing is, I think I'm Blue Shield right now as my insurance company, but tomorrow,

1110
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,160
next time there's an open enrollment, I could switch and join Aetna and then I could decide

1111
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,800
a year later now, I want to go back and do United. I think there are probably stats on this that would

1112
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:24,680
suggest that the average tenure of an individual with a given payer is probably less than four

1113
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:33,960
years. So you have this portability of risk. So if I'm in charge of Marty's risk, but I know that

1114
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:39,880
I've only got Marty's life for three years, what incentive do I have? Let's say you were just

1115
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:46,600
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes today. I know that in 40 years, I know that in 20 years,

1116
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:52,840
you are going to be a nightmare for me to manage from a cost perspective. Your amputations,

1117
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:56,520
your cost of insulin, because even though you're not on insulin today, you're going to be on insulin

1118
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:01,880
then and the cost of insulin is another one of the greatest scams in the history of civilization.

1119
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,960
But in the next three years, are you really going to cost me that much? No. So I don't have

1120
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,000
any incentive to do what you described in the capitated system. I don't own your risk for long

1121
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,640
enough. Whereas in a single payer system, guess what? I own your risk forever. So I actually have

1122
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,720
an incentive to do something about it. So I think it's that coupled with this demand driven system

1123
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:25,000
that has created something broken and then notwithstanding what you just said, which is

1124
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,320
we don't have universal coverage. And I know that's such a politically charged topic and I realize

1125
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,920
in saying that, you just take 50% of the population and you piss them off for saying

1126
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,840
we should have some universal coverage. But what do the polls actually say? I know this is such a

1127
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:47,960
political topic, which I don't understand why this is a political topic. To me, save the political

1128
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,640
topics for things that are political. But what is the public's opposition to some form of universal

1129
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,600
care, at least to cover primary care or some sort of basic expense? Why is someone who

1130
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:07,880
makes $28,000 a year and has health insurance ever getting a bill for $4,000? What's the morality

1131
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:14,600
behind that? And when people understand that fact, how many of them still oppose a net that would

1132
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:20,280
prevent it? You're absolutely right that there's has not been a traditional financial incentive to

1133
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:27,000
reduce long-term health complications and utilization because I even had, don't laugh,

1134
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,600
but I had one insurance executive actually tell me, actually, if we do some things that reduce

1135
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:37,800
long-term complications, we're actually saving money for our competitors. Now he didn't because

1136
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:42,600
he's basically acknowledging that whatever we do today, our competitors will reap the benefit of

1137
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:47,640
because four years from now, this life will be my competitor's life. Yeah, this patient is going

1138
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:51,880
to be with a different carrier for sure. In five years, with the rare exceptions, people just

1139
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:57,160
switched jobs, they switched plans. He was being very honest with me and I had this great relationship

1140
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:01,080
with insurance executives and hospital executives where they're saying, Marty, you're right about

1141
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:06,120
these issues, but I want to do something about it. So he's being honest and he's not saying, I

1142
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:11,800
deliberately do not want to invest in long-term health because I could save my competitors money.

1143
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:17,800
It's just there's no real reward financially to accompany the goodwill that we all have that we

1144
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,440
want what's best for patients. So that's what I love about these, what I call globally capitated

1145
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:27,000
primary care that have lives for the long haul and they're doing incredible things. And if you're a

1146
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,360
business, sign up with Iora Chenmet Oak Street, one of these globally capitated primary care, or get

1147
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:36,760
some of these local primary care practices are pulling together and saying, we want to go to the

1148
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,640
local business and we want to work with them. GM just signed a big contract with Henry Ford Health

1149
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:47,080
System, direct employer contract. I've helped some businesses do these deals, just sort of free service

1150
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:53,320
to I love it. It's the most exciting thing going on right now. But I think the reason why the

1151
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:59,720
outrage has been suppressed is just like we saw with the mortgage crisis and the financial collapse

1152
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:05,560
of 2008. People just don't understand what's happening and the money games have sort of been

1153
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:12,200
flipped around. So for example, if a business gets a higher insurance premium rate for next year,

1154
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:17,560
they'll tell their broker, this is crazy, 11% increase in one year, they'll say, well,

1155
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,560
the cost of drugs and the cost of the reality is it's more than intermediaries. It's the money games.

1156
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:31,480
I have met a couple independent brokers. These brokers in the business routinely and almost

1157
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:37,640
always get paid a giant kickback from the insurance company or the pharmacy benefit manager

1158
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:44,040
for sticking an employer with one of their plants. And it's hard to watch. You realize why people are

1159
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:48,600
paying too much. Sometimes they're not given the best options. I profile it in the price we paid

1160
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,960
businesses that said, no, no, I want another broker. I want an independent broker. And they just

1161
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,600
immediately save half a million dollars or a million dollars. And businesses all over America

1162
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:02,680
are getting ripped off right now in their health insurance and on their pharmacy benefit manager.

1163
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:06,440
So these brokers are not legally required to be fiduciaries.

1164
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:11,160
No, they are routinely accepting. So it's worse than real estate. In real estate,

1165
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:15,880
you know, your agent's not a fiduciary, but at least you know, at least you have transparency

1166
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,040
into what their commission is. It is worse. And it's at least in real estate, you know,

1167
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:24,920
there's a 6% commission in this world of selling health insurance, which by the way, I've not met

1168
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:31,320
a doctor in America who knows how healthcare is sold in America to businesses. This is sort of when

1169
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:37,640
we were memorizing the Krebs cycle 12 times, how about substitute one of those 12 times for a quick

1170
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:43,640
lesson on how healthcare services are bought and sold on a grid like energy. These brokers get a

1171
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:49,320
say in New York, it's a standard 4% commission of every premium dollar the business will spend on

1172
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:54,920
healthcare goes to that broker who cut the initial one time deal they placed you. So imagine you're

1173
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:00,520
a real estate agent getting 5% for life you're paying every year. It's a one time cost. So it's

1174
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,960
not really a good example, but every year business pays a million dollars. 4% goes to the broker who

1175
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:12,920
cut the deal. It'd be like a rental agent. You mean if you cut the deal in 2019 and the employer

1176
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:18,120
keeps going with that same deal, you continue to get your commission on the tail? Yeah. 4% in New

1177
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:22,760
York, it's regulated some places. It's a little competitive, but generally like in New York,

1178
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:28,120
it's 4% for life. So let me ask a question. What is the, if you use the word single payer,

1179
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:35,000
half the country loses their mind. You might as well say we want to resurrect Stalin and put him

1180
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,800
in the white house. Like it is such anathema to our existence. I don't know that a single payer

1181
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:45,640
fixes a lot of problems, but it fixes this problem. Yeah, it fixes this problem. So question one,

1182
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:50,840
why are we so morally opposed to a single payer system? And I'm not sure I would like it by the

1183
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:56,280
way, because when I see the single payer system in Canada, I can point out all of the flaws. And two,

1184
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:02,200
is there a hybrid where you can get some benefits of single payer? Because almost everything I've

1185
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:11,400
heard you say so far is a cost center because of the complexity of negotiation. And so if you took

1186
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,720
out that complexity, you would eliminate the need for a broker. Why do you need a broker? I don't

1187
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:20,840
need a broker when I buy underwear. Why? Because underwear are fricking easy to buy and I can

1188
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:27,160
price shop myself. I mean, most things in my life I don't need a broker for because they're easy to

1189
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:32,920
buy. I mean, the issue here is you need brokers for things that are really complicated to buy. And

1190
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:37,560
I don't think there's anything, I don't think this is an exaggeration. I don't think there's

1191
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:41,720
anything more complicated to buy than health insurance. I want to answer your question about

1192
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:46,120
the Medicare for all issue that's coming up. But real quickly, by the way, the brokers don't like

1193
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:50,600
this either. Okay, they went into this thinking, oh, I'm going to do something good in society.

1194
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,160
I'm going to work in healthcare. I'm going to help businesses and guide them. Then they find

1195
01:46:55,160 --> 01:47:00,120
themselves in these traps where they're getting these cash flow streams, these retention bonuses,

1196
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:05,960
these threats from insurance companies. I profile in the book a guy who basically got fired as a

1197
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:10,920
broker, if you will. They closed all books of business with him because he suggested to an

1198
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:15,160
employer they could get a better deal somewhere else. And it was one of the big Blue Cross Blue

1199
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:19,640
Shield plans. They said, screw you. They wrote him this nasty letter. They trash talked to him.

1200
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:24,280
They closed all his books of business. So all of his lines of revenue, all his steady commissions

1201
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:29,320
and the bonuses on top of that all got shut down. That's catastrophic. If you're a broker,

1202
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:34,600
they don't like living like that. They know I've been, I went to a broker conference and I started

1203
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,920
talking to them and they just start saying, look, this shouldn't be, this is a dirty secret in the

1204
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:43,880
business. We don't even like it right about this. And they gave me these stories and these spreads.

1205
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,240
But the Medicare for all thing, real quick, right now it's polling very high. The American

1206
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:55,000
public is very, very much liking the idea of Medicare for all. The Democrats are running

1207
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,080
with it. As you know, I work with both Democrats and Republicans and the government. I brief,

1208
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:05,640
I advise, I try to be as independent as possible. Medicare for all is very appealing because all of

1209
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:12,280
these money games in this Mirage and Shell game all disappear with a direct Medicare for all system.

1210
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,920
Has anyone done, is there an independent think tank that's done the actual analysis and said,

1211
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:23,640
look, right off the top, you're going to save 8% of $3 trillion if you do that? Is there a sense

1212
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:28,280
of what the benefit is of making that type of a change? My research team's estimated that you

1213
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:35,160
save 15% right off the top when you just immediately, immediately, not even over time. And no

1214
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:39,400
journals interested in publishing that does not a randomized controlled trial, but it's the biggest

1215
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:45,880
issue facing America. Right now, here's the issue I have with switching over to this single payer

1216
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:53,160
Medicare for all system is that over time, historically, governments have shown 100% of

1217
01:48:53,160 --> 01:49:00,040
the time they cannot resist the temptation to make across the board cutbacks on healthcare.

1218
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:06,280
We've done it in Medicare as a country. And so you go 10 or 20 years, sure, you've cut all this waste

1219
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:12,280
initially, but politicians, governments, political will, they cannot resist the urge to just dial

1220
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:17,000
down, dial down their spending on healthcare. And then you're left with these dilapidated systems

1221
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,400
and parts of the UK or other countries where their spending on healthcare is just so weak that when

1222
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:28,200
the doctors like in England went on strike, the government's kind of like, well, you guys are civil

1223
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:34,600
servants, suck it up. And that's what I worry. And if we can accomplish these incredible efficiencies

1224
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:40,280
in the market to cut the waste, I mean, I've seen estimates that as much as 50% of our healthcare

1225
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:45,720
spending is wasted. And if you look at the amount we spend per beneficiary, we're more than double

1226
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:51,000
what some countries are. The average person in the United States might have a total health spend of

1227
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,880
$12,000 per year on average. That's not self funded. It's not your part. It's the overall expenditure.

1228
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:02,600
We are way, way over the curve. And we didn't spend this money growing up when we showed up

1229
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:06,920
to the emergency room with a cut, you might have seen a bill for 100 bucks, but insurance always

1230
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:12,360
took care of it. Now there's a woman who was charged for just checking into the ER. She left

1231
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:18,200
before she went back into the emergency room. And she got this big bill for like 1200 bucks. I mean,

1232
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:25,160
the pricing failures have really hurt. So I like the idea of cutting out the waste. But I think if

1233
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:30,200
we can do it through free market competition, then it's much better for the long term. So,

1234
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:34,440
so Marty, the flip side of there's advantage to a single payer system because you could cut out

1235
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:43,720
all of the machinery that's necessary to make a market understandable. The flip side is,

1236
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:49,960
but a free market works better. And I think that's generally true. I mean, it's hard to argue that

1237
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:54,600
capitalism works. It's hard to argue that it's the least bad option, maybe to put it mildly.

1238
01:50:54,600 --> 01:51:00,920
It's hard to argue that competition is not a good thing. So what's the argument that says, no,

1239
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,720
no, no, no, no, no, a single payer system is a disaster. We want to stay with this sort of

1240
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:12,840
system that has multiple different competitors across every spectrum from hospital systems to

1241
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:19,640
that are each competing to do the best to payers, to PBMs, to brokers and all of these things.

1242
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:24,680
So what's the argument that says don't leave that, but let's just re channel it. Yeah. Well,

1243
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:30,040
I mean, one of the big tasks I've been trying to do is educate the American people. I described

1244
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:34,680
the book, the price we pay as the big short for healthcare. If we can educate employers,

1245
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:41,560
everyday Americans, how to buy drugs, how to buy health insurance, how to ask the questions,

1246
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:46,840
get second opinions, challenge their bills, recognize that when you get one of these massive

1247
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:52,760
bills, you're not legally obligated to pay it. And we're making these legal cases to judges

1248
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:58,360
across America. I've got a group of pro bono lawyers as a part of this restoring medicine

1249
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,360
movement that we're assigning to individuals and we're swimming in cases. I mean, there's

1250
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:06,280
just unlimited cases out there. One in five Americans have medical dent collections.

1251
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:11,480
Well, some of those go to court where basically telling the judges, there's no legal contract.

1252
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:18,360
How can I mow your lawn and then send you a bill for $5,000 and say, well, that's what I charge. I

1253
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:24,520
mean, you'd say we have no legal contract. How could I cut your hair for 30 bucks? And then one

1254
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:29,480
year you come in and I say, it's $900. There's no legal contract. So this is a very important

1255
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,680
point, Marty, because I didn't know this. Yesterday we had dinner and one of the people we had dinner

1256
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:39,880
with who's just amazing, we could go off on stories on how amazing that guy is in his work.

1257
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:46,040
Yeah, African doctor. Yeah. But he told a story of his son needed an endoscopy and they're back

1258
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,720
in the US for this. And so to get an endoscopy, which is a tube that goes into your esophagus and

1259
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:55,080
your stomach and takes a look around and comes back out and makes sure everything is okay. You

1260
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:58,920
have a lot of fees in there. You've got the fee for the gastroenterologist who's doing it. There's

1261
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:04,120
a hospital fee for that. There's an anesthesia fee because you need an anesthesiologist to give you

1262
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:08,040
some sedating medication. So you're not under complete anesthesia, but you're comfortable so

1263
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:12,520
that you're not gagging at this thing happening. And it turned out that the hospital was inside

1264
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:16,840
the network. The professional fee for the gastroenterologist was quote unquote inside the network.

1265
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:21,640
But the fee for the anesthesiologist was not inside the network because for no reasons that

1266
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:26,680
this patient could ever understand, the anesthesia bill came from a group that was outside of the

1267
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:34,040
network. So he got a bill for $10,000 for the anesthesia portion of this, which let's just

1268
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:40,040
call a spade a spade Marty, that's putting an IV in somebody and for 30 minutes taking care of them

1269
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:44,680
after you've administered some propofol. I mean, let's just be completely honest about what actually

1270
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:49,800
happened there. So a few dollars worth of propofol and some IV equipment and an EKG and a pulse

1271
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,880
oximeter and you're watching someone for 30 minutes. So I might be in the wrong business,

1272
01:53:53,880 --> 01:54:00,280
by the way, if that's 10,000 bucks, that is insulting to what money means. So there's two

1273
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,920
issues I'd like to understand there. One, what in God's name does it have to do with the fact that

1274
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:09,320
that was in or out of network, that such an egregious charge could be levied on that patient?

1275
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:14,600
And two, what is the legal obligation of that patient and how can that patient

1276
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:20,360
fight and say, this is totally bullshit, we're not doing this. Well, right now, the judges have

1277
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:26,200
been sympathetic to the hospitals and we're trying to show the legal argument that there's no

1278
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:30,680
contract. When you walk into the emergency room today with a cut, chances are they're going to

1279
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:35,080
give you some form and say, you have to sign this and the person giving it to you doesn't know squat

1280
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:39,800
about what's in it. You could be in excruciating abdominal pain and need to go have your appendix

1281
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:44,520
removed. You're signing it at a vulnerable time. Well, and in fact, let's take a step further.

1282
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:49,880
If you have a pre-numptual agreement and you want to get that held up and there's any evidence that

1283
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:54,680
that was signed under duress, guess what? It doesn't matter. And I don't know about you,

1284
01:54:54,680 --> 01:55:00,280
but an acute abdomen sounds like duress. Yeah. I mean, if you're in a criminal trial and somebody

1285
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:06,440
says, gives the key evidence that somebody murdered somebody, the other lawyers could argue

1286
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:11,320
entrapment. He felt a little pressured to offer that confession and then it's negated. And yet,

1287
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:17,240
in the hospital, not only is there no contract sometimes, but there's this document that is

1288
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:22,840
fooling you into thinking it's a consent to be treated. But there's a law in the United States

1289
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:27,960
called M.Tala that requires any hospital to take care of any urgent or emergent patient that walks

1290
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,440
into their door. It's not dependent on giving your credit card when you check in. It's not

1291
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:37,000
dependent on giving your social security number and your mom's address and all these other things

1292
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,200
that they try to collect. You don't have to do that. Hospitals are required by law. It's called

1293
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:47,560
M.Tala to take care of anyone with an urgent or emergent condition. If you feel that there's a

1294
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:52,600
legal document that you have to sign your home and your financial life away in order to get stitches

1295
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:57,960
and you're concerned about predatory billing, you sign in that little signature box in the iPad.

1296
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:03,880
You sign did not read because no one's going to read what you sign in there. Okay. And then when

1297
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:08,680
the collectors call and the judge says you have to provide your routing number and your account

1298
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:13,640
number or we're going to garnish your wages, you say there's no legal contract. We're trying to

1299
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:19,160
empower people in the United States to say we need a competent and fair pricing system. The

1300
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:23,880
surprise bill issues, by the way, people are getting hammered. The surprise bills right now

1301
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:28,120
hammered. And why are they so hard to understand? I'm taking you off that question, but I get about

1302
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:33,640
three EOBs, explanation of benefits per month, maybe four of them. I feel like there's a never

1303
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:38,920
ending stream of them. You take your kid to the pediatrician because he's got a fever and you

1304
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:42,360
think you might have an ear infection. The pediatrician looks in the ear, confirms that he

1305
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:47,320
does. You get some amoxicillin, you go home, everybody's happy. I get six EOBs for that

1306
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:53,640
encounter. Each one saying something I can't understand. This is what we build. This is what

1307
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:58,680
your insurance company paid. This is what you're responsible for. And then they attach a check to

1308
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:05,880
it. And I'm like, what? I don't get it. And again, if I don't get it, at least one other person

1309
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:12,760
listening to this doesn't get it. Right. Well, look, I took one of those bills to a hospital CEO.

1310
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:16,200
Like I said, I've got great relationships with a lot of these hospital CEOs. Quite honestly,

1311
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:20,280
sometimes they're just disconnected from what's happening with their revenue cycle department.

1312
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:22,840
Don't you love that word? Revenue cycle. Collections.

1313
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:30,440
One woman handed me her card and it literally said on it, director of revenue enhancement.

1314
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:39,800
Oh gosh. Hippocrates man would just be rolling over in his grave.

1315
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:44,520
It's funny. I hope that the guys in the mafia are listening to this and upping their game a

1316
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,360
little bit because if you're running collections in the mafia, you should at least have a revenue

1317
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:55,560
enhancement card. Well, in Florida, drug dealers have given up drugs and turned to doing medical

1318
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:59,480
fraud because it's more profitable and they can make more money. I don't know if you know,

1319
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:04,920
but the Medicare anti fraud offices, I know the head of the division, they essentially closed

1320
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:10,760
down most of the regional offices and move them all to Florida because Florida is just the rampant

1321
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:16,440
center of a lot of abuse. So you show any OB to a hospital CEO. Yeah, they can't even interpret

1322
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:22,440
the bill. I mean, there was a buddy of mine who had a friend get a $5,000 bill for an hour in

1323
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:26,920
the emergency room or something like that. Did a couple simple things and the bill was over

1324
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:32,760
$5,000. Took it to my friend who's a consultant knows the healthcare executives went to the CEO

1325
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,920
and knew the CEO. He said, by the way, my friend went to your emergency room. She was in the ER.

1326
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,480
She got the little oxygen nasal cannula and an IV and was sent home about 45 minutes later.

1327
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:46,680
Guess how much the bill was? And of course he's cringing, embarrassed. And he says, I don't know,

1328
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:52,360
$1,500. No, it was 5,000. Oh my God. You know, he's like, let me take care of that for you.

1329
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:57,400
And there's this embarrassment when it comes up that yes, we've allowed this game of dialing up

1330
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:03,080
bills and then offering these bigger discounts as shiny objects to employers and insurance companies

1331
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:07,720
has gotten so out of control that the victims, as hospital CEOs will often tell me, Marty,

1332
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:12,120
you're so right, but nobody pays those bills. Those are sticker prices. We give discounts

1333
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:17,320
liberally. Well, not to the people I'm meeting in Fredericksburg, Virginia and Carlsbad, New Mexico,

1334
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:20,920
who are fighting their bills and they're, they can't even get a call center representative and

1335
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:25,080
they're being harassed and the collectors are calling saying now it's in the hand of collectors.

1336
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:28,760
So you can't talk to the hospital. And let's explain what that CEO is trying to explain to

1337
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,480
you, which is, look, we want to make this look really good. So something like coming into the

1338
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:38,920
ER, having a nasal cannula and IV and an EKG and sending you out, we're going to put a sticker price

1339
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,880
on that of $5,000 and we don't really think anybody's going to pay it, but what we're going

1340
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:50,680
to do is we're going to tell the insurance company or the employer, we normally charge $5,000 for this.

1341
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:57,320
But for you, my friend today, one time only, if you sign up now, this will only cost $500.

1342
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:03,640
And you're thinking it's a great discount. We're all over it. And if a different company shows up,

1343
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,000
they might get a different rate. They might get a different discount. So different people can get

1344
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,640
different discounts on the same egregious price that serves no purpose other than to make you

1345
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:15,640
feel like you're offering a great discount. I mean, can you imagine if the rest of the world

1346
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:19,720
ran on this principle? Like into a grocery store. Yeah, exactly. The restaurant. I'll have the

1347
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:24,680
Tica Masala, please. Well, here's the deal. Who's your employer? It's a thousand dollars.

1348
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:28,760
Who do you work for? I work for Walgreens. Oh, take this with you. Well,

1349
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,920
the Tica Masala is not a thousand for you. It's only a hundred dollars for you. And the guy

1350
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:40,440
sitting across from you works somewhere else and well, it's $50 for him. Right. But he gets a 2%

1351
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:46,840
discount on the 50 on the 50. So he's only paying 49 employers to tell me all the time, our insurance

1352
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:51,880
company, we get a 40% discount. Well, I'll give you a 99% discount. If I'm selling you a car,

1353
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:57,400
as long as I get to set the price, you can have a 99% discount. Is there another example in our

1354
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:02,120
economy that works this way? Well, there is bulk purchasing and retail, but here's what I would

1355
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:08,840
add to your example that you very well describe. In addition to these secret discounts, both parties

1356
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:14,760
are sworn to secrecy that this discount cannot be made public and that kills the competition.

1357
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:21,800
And that's what we're working on with legislation. And that's legal. It is legal to put a gag on

1358
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:28,520
the chicanery. Yeah. Okay. So going back to our friend from yesterday, the reason he gets a

1359
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:35,480
$10,000 bill for someone putting in an IV and some propofol is because the anesthesia group set a

1360
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:39,880
price that was ridiculous, not necessarily expecting people were going to pay this out of

1361
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:44,680
pocket. Again, they didn't go into this trying to kill people for whatever reason. The anesthesiologist

1362
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:48,600
who was probably supposed to do that case was maybe not. So someone else comes in, they're out

1363
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:55,720
of network. And now that ridiculous price actually sticks to this patient. Now, what is

1364
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:01,640
his legal recourse in that situation? He got overcharged. Yeah. I mean, what we're telling them

1365
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:07,400
is you argue as strong as you can argue to the collectors, to the courts, if they take it to

1366
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:12,440
court, to whoever, that they need to provide the legal contract. Sure. Yeah. Oh, they're chart.

1367
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:18,360
They want $10,000. Just send me the agreement. I understand it's part of my consumer rights

1368
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:23,480
that when a collections agency calls that I'm entitled to see the contract or agreement that

1369
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:28,680
obligates me to pay. What type of contracts are being produced at that request? Well, I've never

1370
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:33,320
seen a collections agency produce a contract because it's that little iPad form that you sign

1371
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:38,280
in the lobby or something that doesn't exist or it's combined with a consent to trade. So it

1372
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:42,920
doesn't exist at the beginning. So let's say open enrollments every January. I mean, I'm sure we

1373
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:47,640
sign something in January when we enroll. Is that the contract? Is there something in there that the

1374
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:51,880
collections agency can come back and say, well, Marty, I'm not going to show you a contract from

1375
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:56,680
when you were in the ER in May. I'm going to show you a contract from January when you signed up

1376
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:00,040
through open enrollment. No, because that's a contract between you and the insurance company.

1377
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,960
It's not a contract between you and the medical center. Oh, good point. And they're the party

1378
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:09,800
that's going after you. So this is a great point. So the only time you're being technically

1379
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:16,840
presented with a contract for price is at the providers level. And we're basically saying it's

1380
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:21,640
very easy to render that contract null and void. Yeah. And sometimes it doesn't exist or logistically,

1381
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:25,800
honestly, they just can't produce it. They send the what they call bad debt to the collectors and

1382
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:30,120
collectors go after you, but they're not saying I love the idea of signing did not read did not

1383
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:35,800
read exactly. Oh, no, I didn't ever entered a legal agreement obligated me to pay if I did

1384
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:40,360
show me the thing. The other thing we're telling people to do if it's really egregious contact your

1385
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:45,560
state's attorney and contact your local news network. Unfortunately, some of the local news

1386
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:51,800
networks, their number one client is the local hospital that's running ads. This complex is

1387
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:56,680
gigantic. It's incredible, but contact them and tell them a friend Sarah cliff at Vox,

1388
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:00,760
Elizabeth Rosenthal at Kaiser health news, they each have sections where you can send in your

1389
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:05,640
bills. I'm swimming. I'm underwater. I've got I don't know, 54,000 emails. I haven't read probably

1390
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:10,440
half the number of emails you have and have not read. I'm going to try to clean it out this weekend.

1391
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:15,960
But so many people are getting hammered out there. It's like an unlimited drinking from a fire

1392
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,520
hydrant. But those are things people should do. Ask for the contract sign if you feel like it's

1393
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,840
not a fair agreement. If you're not disclosed prices now, I wish I knew this two years ago

1394
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:30,760
when we got stiffed with some $15,000 bill for an ambulance ride. Well, you know, one of our friends

1395
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:36,600
from residency that had a sort of a catastrophic medical illness in Australia. Yes. And he was

1396
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:41,640
flown back. We all paid money to chip in for this. There was a whole Facebook page where

1397
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:45,800
we were all kicking in thousands of dollars for his care. I mean, yeah. So what happened?

1398
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:50,920
I don't want to upset you, but some of that money. Do I get a refund on that? Was that all given

1399
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:55,320
back to him? I mean, this guy's one of my best friends and it was awesome to see everyone come

1400
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:00,280
together. But the flight back, they charged him like a quarter million dollars. Okay. For that

1401
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:07,320
flight, you could get a private G seven and fly to Beijing and back five times for that money.

1402
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:12,040
That was just pure price gouging. And actually I had got him some legal help to knock that bill

1403
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:16,200
down because this came outside of his insurance. Like his insurance decided they didn't cover that

1404
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:21,160
kind of stuff. Bingo, you just nailed the number one story of the modern American healthcare system

1405
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:27,560
entities, organizations, doctors, hospitals, ambulances, helicopters have figured out. If you

1406
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:33,800
bill outside of insurance, you can just gouge and some people will pay it. And if you just send it

1407
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:39,320
to collections and harass and send them 50 bills, some people will just pay it. And the reality is

1408
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:43,880
God's been good to you and I. If we got a $5,000 bill, we'd find a way just to pay it. It might be

1409
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:48,840
annoying, but we'll find it. But half of America has less than $300 in savings. People are getting

1410
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:54,200
hammered. Oh God, that's so upsetting. Now, can I talk about something positive on this subject?

1411
02:05:54,200 --> 02:06:00,120
Yeah, please. Please for the love of humanity. Talk about one good thing here.

1412
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:08,760
Keith Smith in Oklahoma City has basically said, this is total BS. I don't understand how a doctor

1413
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:14,360
can take an oath, treat a patient and ruin their life financially. It's against everything I've

1414
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:21,000
ever considered sacred about this heritage of medicine. He has offered one bundled price for

1415
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,880
every service at his medical center. If you come in and you need a shoulder surgery, you don't get

1416
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:31,880
a bill for the epidural separate and from the anesthesiologist pro-feed separate, they got their

1417
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:37,320
act together and hospitals need to get their act together instead of sort of the finger pointing

1418
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:44,760
of, oh, well, that's the lab. The lab is billing you separately. We laugh at this because it's so

1419
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:50,360
true. It's pure gouging and we're all paying for it. It's not all my insurance paid or my Medicare

1420
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:58,920
paid $4,000 to test for one gene allele. You can genome your whole 23andMe cost what, 150 bucks.

1421
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:04,040
And that's like all these gene tests. So we've seen that genes that are in the 23andMe panel

1422
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:10,200
billed separately for thousands of dollars. So people need to ask when we all started, and I have

1423
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:14,920
you to thank a little bit for this, started asking about healthy foods. You remember that conversation

1424
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:18,920
early on when you were learning about this subject and you're like, Marty, this is incredible what

1425
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:22,920
I'm learning. I started asking in restaurants, what kind of food is this and does this have this

1426
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:28,280
and how is it prepared? And it's putting pressure on the restaurants. It's driving the market,

1427
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:33,240
the food label world, the food industry is now trying to say, hey, this has these healthy

1428
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:40,120
ingredients that are good. This has no added sugar. And so the inquiries are moving the market.

1429
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:45,080
And in addition to Keith Smith disrupting healthcare in Oklahoma, and it's awesome that

1430
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:49,240
insurance companies hate him, the hospitals hate him, right? All these people want him to fail.

1431
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:54,760
It's like Elon Musk, everybody shorting, everyone wants him to fail, but he's actually growing like

1432
02:07:55,320 --> 02:08:02,440
crazy. People are flying in from Japan to Oklahoma City. Why? Because they have a fair and honest

1433
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:08,120
bundled price. He had 200 Canadians, I think last year, we did a study at Hopkins of all the

1434
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:13,160
price transparency medical centers in the United States before and after they decided to go

1435
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:18,600
full honest pricing, not charge master pricing, but the real price. Not, oh, here's a price and

1436
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:23,960
we're going to give you a discount of 2%, right? The real price. And they all do incredibly well.

1437
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:28,760
Their business goes up, their satisfaction goes up. We publish the study. This is the future. It's

1438
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:34,520
exciting. It's disruptive. It's why I'm so up on medicine right now. And you think that this is

1439
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:41,880
potentially a better solution, which is basically still private healthcare, but with market demanded

1440
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:48,360
transparency. I do. I do. Look, it's very appealing to wipe out all the money games overnight with

1441
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:52,920
a single payer. It's very, very tempting. And you know what? People are advocates for it are

1442
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:58,200
absolutely correct. It will slash the money games overnight. It'll just put it to a screeching halt.

1443
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:02,360
But over time, historically, if you look academically at every government that's done it,

1444
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:08,680
they cannot resist the temptation to just skim cut, skim cut year after year, 10 or 20 years.

1445
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:11,880
Yeah. And I don't want to live in Canada. I mean, I don't want to live in a Canadian healthcare

1446
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:15,880
system either because I see what my parents experience. I see what my whole family is still

1447
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:21,880
in Canada. Every single person, my family is still in Canada. And I wouldn't trade places with a single

1448
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:26,760
one of them for their healthcare. Even though average, it's infinitely better than American

1449
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:31,960
healthcare in terms of accessibility and cost. My Dean of Harvard School of Public Health,

1450
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:36,920
when I was a student, said, Canadian is essentially an unarmed American with health insurance.

1451
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:44,280
No, I agree with you. We have an incredible healthcare system. The problem is it works for

1452
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:48,200
the wealthy and it works most of the time and the reliability is not there. But the only reason it

1453
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:52,920
works for the wealthy is something you said a moment ago. It's that the cost of the care for

1454
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:58,920
the wealthy falls below the hurdle rate of hassle. I mean, is there any place in the country that

1455
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:04,360
someone of means would rather get their healthcare? No, I don't know the last time an American of means

1456
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:09,400
left the US to get their healthcare. It's the exact opposite. Hopkins, I feel like half the

1457
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:15,480
people we took care of were outside of the United States. So there's no question that we have the

1458
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:21,880
best healthcare when it's applied correctly, which is to say the quality of care we have,

1459
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:26,680
the potential to deliver is exceptional under the right circumstances. That's a lot of caveating.

1460
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:33,720
We have a cost crisis and we have an access crisis. And the two people, the two subsets of

1461
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:38,360
people who are therefore going to be crushed in the US healthcare system are people who cannot

1462
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:44,840
afford access at all and people who can't afford egregious costs when levied upon them. If you're

1463
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:49,800
not in those two camps, you're going to be okay. It's annoying as hell, but you're going to be okay.

1464
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:56,280
And I think that's what's allowed this system to sort of limp its way along. And I guess what I'm

1465
02:10:56,280 --> 02:11:02,040
hearing you say is we might, I hate to use the term tipping point, but we might be at a tipping

1466
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:08,520
point where it's become so egregious that even the people now who, A, there might be enough people

1467
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:13,560
that are moving into the latter categories of, okay, this is now if one in five people are getting

1468
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:18,840
collections through healthcare, I mean, we have a fundamental problem. Half of women with stage four

1469
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:24,040
breast cancer in the United States, a recent study just came out at ASCO, half of women with stage

1470
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:28,840
four breast cancer in the United States are being harassed by medical debt collectors. Did you talk

1471
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:32,760
to the medical debt collectors? Well, that study was published by another group. Oh no, but in

1472
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:36,920
general. Oh yeah. And are they feeling, I mean, how are they feeling? Let's try to do something

1473
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:40,760
we talked about earlier. Let's try to have empathy for them. You need a job. Everybody needs a job.

1474
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:45,000
So I got a job. I'm a medical debt collector. Do I feel good about myself? I mean, I'm calling a

1475
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,640
woman with stage four breast cancer every day and threatening her. That's a good person that's on the

1476
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:54,200
phone. I don't believe that that medical debt collector is some like evil incarnate. No. So how

1477
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,360
do they feel about what they have to do? Well, some of them hate their life. I would say for the most

1478
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:05,320
part, they are glad to be in a position where for the most part, if you object, fight your bill,

1479
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:12,360
they're going to just knock off 20, 50% right off the top. And this is another tip for people out

1480
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:16,840
there. Bills are negotiable. When you get your bill, they are negotiable. I wish I knew this when

1481
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:22,600
I got that goddamn ambulance bill a few years ago. Yeah. I mean, imagine they're kind of hoping that

1482
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:27,240
you, I don't want to say hoping, like you say, we have all good people working in a bad system,

1483
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:32,840
but the business model relies on some people just saying, oh, screw it. I'll pay. And entire

1484
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:40,920
careers in industry is slogan, right? The business model is quote, ah, screw it. I'll just, I'll just

1485
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:47,720
pay. Right. And these folks in the so-called revenue cycle world, they're in revenue enhancement,

1486
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:53,240
revenue enhancement, revenue enhancement. I mean, how did I discover these people? I get invited to

1487
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:57,880
speak at a lot of conferences as you do. And I never actually get invited to speak at conferences,

1488
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:02,760
by the way. Oh, well, consider yourself invited to everyone I've done. No, no, I'm happy to not.

1489
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:08,200
So they say I got invited to this conference of revenue cycle managers. And I just, sure,

1490
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:12,520
I'm happy to speak to them. It's a nice, that's awesome. I mean, that's a great opportunity for

1491
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:17,400
you to learn. Yeah. And that's basically this book, The Price We Pay is a two year tour around

1492
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:23,720
America talking to patients and revenue cycle people and businesses and brokers and everybody.

1493
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:28,040
I wanted to talk to everybody and get their point of view. And I don't believe there's any one bad

1494
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:32,840
villain. I think it's the system, but the revenue cycle people I show up and I'm like, I'm sorry,

1495
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:38,440
I just got out of the operating room and flew into town. Who are you people? What is revenue cycle?

1496
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:43,320
What do you do? And is this in healthcare or are you outside of health? What is it? Are you tax

1497
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:47,960
accountants? And they explained to me how it works. And I look out, there's a conference of like

1498
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:53,080
4,000 people. And I'm like, does every hospital have one of these? You know, this, oh yeah,

1499
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:58,040
every hospital has department at Duke. At one point, there were more people working on billing

1500
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:02,040
and revenue cycle than there were beds in the hospital. Come on, that can't be true.

1501
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:06,920
No, this is a true fact. I think they had 900 beds and they had it just over that in terms of

1502
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,480
billing, coding and revenue cycle and managing these discount.

1503
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:15,400
Okay, so let me give you another contrarian argument. If you fix the healthcare system,

1504
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:21,160
how many people are going to lose a job? A lot. Healthcare is an enormous industry. It employs

1505
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:25,400
tens of millions of people. Yeah. What are those people going to do now? Well, you can make the

1506
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:30,680
same argument about the financial mortgage crisis. You had all these people selling subprime mortgages

1507
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:35,400
and getting rich and employing other people in these giant companies. Healthcare is a gigantic

1508
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:41,560
bubble right now. And the parallels to the financial crisis are striking. And at some point,

1509
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:46,440
if you think about it, we are spending money we don't have on products that we don't even need

1510
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:53,160
sometimes. The PBM world, medical services that are unnecessary, the enormous middle layers,

1511
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:58,440
and doctors quite honestly are very suspicious of what's happening. They don't understand. I mean,

1512
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:04,040
I didn't understand until I started touring and to go into these conferences and saying, I'm sick

1513
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:09,480
of this. I'm a professor of health policy. I don't feel like I have a handle on the entire

1514
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:15,800
healthcare system. And I decided enough is enough. I want to learn, educate myself on every tiny

1515
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:22,120
detail of this ginormous system. I want to know every law, Medicaid rule, insurance, contract,

1516
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:26,920
negotiation, talk to the negotiators. What goes on at that meeting? Well, they say our prices are

1517
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:31,560
going to go up by 10% next year, but we're going to give you a 12% discount. And then they turn

1518
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:37,560
around and dial up the prices 15%. And then the hospital says, oh, good job, Bob. I'm just making

1519
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:43,880
it up. You generated another $4 million for us. You're now promoted to whatever title. This

1520
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:48,360
gigantic industry. And they're coming up to me at the conferences and other places and telling me,

1521
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:53,000
I do this and this, but quite honestly, my job doesn't need to exist. If we had honest and fair

1522
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:00,040
pricing in America, we wouldn't need this gigantic negotiating of discounts and markups, the markup

1523
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:04,680
discount game, I call it. And one important thing. And one thing I'd ask you and all your listeners

1524
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:10,840
to do is use the honest lexicon, just like we talked about medical care gone wrong versus a

1525
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:16,600
preventable adverse event. Let's use the patient centered terms. Let's talk about prices and not

1526
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:23,000
costs. Let's remember that we're paying not our insurance company or our employer or other folks.

1527
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:28,360
Let's talk about bills. You shouldn't be getting their high refer to them as predatory billing

1528
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:34,200
practices or predatory medicine screenings you don't need. So let's talk a little bit about that.

1529
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:42,760
You talked about how studies have looked at what percentage of tests that physicians order. Do they

1530
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:50,520
deem unnecessary? So in other words, you go and you pull a thousand doctors and you say secretly

1531
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:55,560
and confidentially, so no one's going to come and spank you for this. How often are you ordering

1532
02:16:55,560 --> 02:17:02,520
a test that is unnecessary? And the answer turned out to be 21%. 21% was the average. Now actually,

1533
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:07,800
yeah, yeah, the average. The question said, excluding your own practice in your observations.

1534
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:14,120
Got it. Okay. Okay. As we develop practice pattern measures of waste, which is a big project we're

1535
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:19,560
doing at Johns Hopkins with some other groups, we've asked doctors, tell us about an egregious area

1536
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:25,320
of overuse in your specialty, something that's done too much in a certain clinical situation.

1537
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:29,720
Sometimes they'll be like, I can't really think of anything. And then we'll say, well, think about

1538
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:34,760
your competitor groups. Are they doing other stuff? Oh my God. Yeah, they're doing endoscopies

1539
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:39,720
every six months after an initial screening. They're doing 50 biopsies and all this stuff.

1540
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:44,200
So it's easier to get an answer when you don't force the lens inward. Right. And I think it's

1541
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:50,600
back to our opening conversation. We work our tails off in residency. How dare we start saying

1542
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:55,560
that you've crossed over to an area of entitlement and burnout where you do too much unnecessary.

1543
02:17:55,560 --> 02:17:59,480
Let's talk about the system. It's not a threatening, we talk about low value care

1544
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:02,360
in the medical literature. And that's how we're talking about this subject.

1545
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:06,360
Now you could take a couple of those into, I've always thought of this as an area that doesn't

1546
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:11,560
get enough attention because I sort of divided into two categories. So let's take one of the

1547
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:15,960
most egregious examples, which I'm sure we'll upset a few people, which is interventional

1548
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:20,920
cardiology. There's a lot of people already upset from the podcast. Yeah, we've upset a lot of

1549
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:26,680
people. Okay. So the medical literature on stenting is like all things in the medical

1550
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:30,760
literature. There's some room for interpretation, but there are some things that we kind of know.

1551
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:37,400
So if somebody is having an ST elevated wave MI and they're hemodynamically unstable in the

1552
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:41,240
emergency room, those are patients that do a lot better when you put a stent in them.

1553
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:44,840
This can be life saving. Yep. You're going to save that person's life. So we're here to say

1554
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:49,240
stents are not bad. Okay. But then there's a whole body of literature that makes it also pretty

1555
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:52,600
clear that there are a whole bunch of people that don't seem to get any better with stents,

1556
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:56,280
meaning there's no evidence you're going to save their life. And that's not the only

1557
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:59,800
reason to put a stent in because if you save a person from having another heart attack,

1558
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:03,960
that might be a reason anyone who's had a heart attack would say, I don't care if it

1559
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:07,720
reduces my risk of dying, but just not having a heart attack would be a benefit or if it reduces

1560
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:13,560
chest pain. So you have this whole other group of people who actually have no benefit of a stent,

1561
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:16,760
doesn't reduce chest pain, doesn't reduce subsequent heart attack, and it doesn't save a

1562
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:19,720
life. And then you get into the business of, well, how many stents should you put in?

1563
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:24,920
You know where I'm going with this, right? There are interventional cardiologists out there that

1564
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:30,600
are putting stents in people and violating every aspect of what is known, meaning they're putting

1565
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:35,560
them into the wrong patients and they're putting in far too many and they're getting paid by the

1566
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:40,440
stent. Okay. You've actually talked publicly about this in the dermatology world about people doing

1567
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:47,240
Mohs surgery. That's one type of bad actor in the system. And you could argue some of that is

1568
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:52,200
conscious, some of that is subconscious. So it might be the case that that doctor who is putting

1569
02:19:52,760 --> 02:20:00,920
five stents in the person with stable angina who's never shown even evidence of MI or EKG change,

1570
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:06,040
deep down is a good person and thinks that they know something that none of the studies have ever

1571
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:12,200
shown and I get that. Okay. And then within that, there's going to be some nefarious actors who are

1572
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:17,400
simply used car salesman gone wrong. I just realized I insulted a bunch of used car salesman,

1573
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:20,920
but they're people who are literally just shaking down the system and they know that they're going

1574
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:25,080
to get a thousand bucks for every stent they put in. So I'm going to put five in this guy today,

1575
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:29,400
even though he probably needs zero. My impression, which could be entirely incorrect, is that the

1576
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:35,480
majority of unnecessary care is not in that category. It's in a different category, which

1577
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:43,880
has two ends to it. One is the I don't have the time to deal with figuring out exactly what the

1578
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:50,600
right thing to do is and the cost of me giving in and giving someone an antibiotic when I'm pretty

1579
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:55,640
sure they have a viral infection that's going to go away in three days. The cost of me trying to

1580
02:20:55,640 --> 02:21:00,520
educate the patient on that and explain antibiotic resistance, it's just too high. I've only got 15

1581
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:06,440
minutes. I'll just give them the goddamn Z-pack. That's one. And then the second subset of that,

1582
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:11,240
which by the way, I think is the worst one, is the I'm not going to be the guy that gets sued

1583
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:17,080
because I didn't order the head CT on the person with a headache, even though I know that this

1584
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:22,040
person stopped drinking coffee two days ago and they went from three cups of coffee a day to

1585
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:28,360
nothing and they're coming in here with the worst headache of their life. And I'm pretty 99.999%

1586
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:32,360
sure it's caffeine withdrawal, but I'm not going to let this person walk out of this ER without a

1587
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:38,520
head CT because if God forbid it's a tumor or an aneurysm, I'm going to get sued. So everyone gets

1588
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:43,800
a head CT. I mean, I told a funny story last night at dinner that I won't repeat, but of a patient

1589
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:49,880
coming in with complaining that their hair was vibrating and they get a head CT because the ER

1590
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:55,640
docs like as an individual, I know that's bad for the system, but as an individual, it's in my best

1591
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:00,280
interest to do that. Or one time I saw a patient with hair vibrating and I got a CT and it showed

1592
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:09,400
a cancer. Yeah, I'm like Osler reincarnated. I'm so good. I suspected that that vibrating hair was

1593
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:17,320
actually a meningioma beneath the surface. This to me is a very dirty problem in America, which is

1594
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:22,040
we are a very litigious culture and it is that. So when people talk about medical malpractice,

1595
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:26,120
which I want to come back to because you alluded to it, people tend to be dismissive of it and say

1596
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:29,800
it's not actually that big a part of medicine because they're looking at the actual cost of

1597
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:35,880
medical malpractice. What I think they're missing is the threat of medical malpractice has created

1598
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:45,080
a culture of completely unnecessary testing as part of the CYA fellowship that everyone gets

1599
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:51,400
taught in medicine. So somewhere down the line, each of us in residency was taught cover your ass,

1600
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:58,040
which means you are doing stuff that is not good, but it is going to look good in a deposition

1601
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:06,200
in the worst case outcome here. Now, how do you fix that problem? Good medical care. So for every

1602
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:11,640
five docs in the ER that will say if somebody has a headache, you just for liability reasons need to

1603
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:17,240
get a CAT scan or an MRI. I bet you there's a senior doc who says, no, you don't look. People

1604
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:22,120
are more likely to sue you because they're just angry at you or they're incredibly dissatisfied

1605
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:27,480
than because you failed to order a test and do the right thing and you can defend it if you need

1606
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:33,000
to defend it that the patient had a moderate headache. And so really good sound judgment. I

1607
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,360
mean, I love these very senior wise doctors that say do the right thing. Don't just react to some

1608
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:45,000
fear of a potential risk. The unnecessary testing and unnecessary doing things because of malpractice

1609
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:51,400
concerns is definitely a problem in certain pockets of medicine, the emergency room and OB

1610
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:57,240
they're getting hammered in OB. But it's not the driver, you know, people it's so vivid to us

1611
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:02,280
doctors and it seems so wrong and so unnecessary and you want to blame these lawyers that have

1612
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:08,440
these contingency games. The reality is it is such an inconsequential small fraction of the medical

1613
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:13,960
spend. Even though most doctors think it's one of the primary drivers of our higher health care

1614
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:18,760
costs. When you say it's insignificant, you mean the actual cost of malpractice insurance litigation

1615
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:22,760
and things like that? Well, not just that, but studies have shown it's not just doing stuff that

1616
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:29,160
costs money, but you are avoiding things because of malpractice concerns. People may avoid surgery.

1617
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:35,480
I don't want to touch this guy because if something goes wrong, I don't want to have that liability.

1618
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:40,920
So you also have avoiding care because of malpractice concerns. I remember once in clinic

1619
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:47,800
a discussion coming up with a patient that was an attorney and the attending said complex case

1620
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:52,600
and an attorney don't do it. Right, exactly. I mean, like, you know, you asking to be sued

1621
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:58,440
if something goes wrong? Yeah. So how many unnecessary head scans the Medicare pays 300

1622
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:05,000
bucks for did that one of operation avoidance balance out? So if you talk to the real scholars

1623
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,240
of health care costs, they'll tell you it's not malpractice. I know it's an emotional issue.

1624
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:14,920
Yeah. And it's not the malpractice, but you're saying even the over treatment to minimize the

1625
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:23,560
risk of it. So what about another thing, which is do we have a culture of just expecting that? Like,

1626
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:28,440
so how many times has you got that patient who comes in who said, I stopped drinking coffee

1627
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:33,400
three days ago. I've got a really bad headache, but I'm really worried. And is there ever room

1628
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:38,360
for the discussion that says, look, in my judgment, and I've already talked to three of my colleagues

1629
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:43,960
here today. We all think that your headache is from caffeine withdrawal. And we think you should

1630
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:49,080
take Tylenol and maybe have a coffee and maybe taper off as opposed to just going from three

1631
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:53,480
coffees to zero coffees. But if you really, really want to see T scan, we'll do it. It's going to cost

1632
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:58,360
this much. Now your insurance company is going to cover this much, but you're going to cover this

1633
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:03,160
much. I mean, that seems like a reasonable discussion. I mean, again, it's artificial in

1634
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:07,880
that I can't imagine an ER doc having the luxury of time to sit down and have that, let alone the

1635
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:15,080
transparency into pricing. But to me, that's the way the world works in everything else. I mean,

1636
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:22,280
Marty, if you want to buy a Ferrari, you can. You know how much it costs and you would presumably

1637
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:27,720
decide that car is worth more than a house. You would make that decision if you felt that way.

1638
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:33,960
So in theory, you should be able to say to people, look, I'm your advocate here as the doctor. I

1639
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:38,280
don't think you need a head CT. If I was in your situation, I would not want the radiation.

1640
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:41,480
I think people don't understand the radiation they're getting in CT.

1641
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:43,160
A hundred times more than an x-ray.

1642
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:46,680
I don't think you should be allowed into a CT scanner without someone telling you how many

1643
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:50,840
milli-seave roots you're getting and showing you the NRC guidelines for how many milli-seave roots

1644
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,840
of radiation you should be exposed to. And look, I order CT scans on patients all the time,

1645
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:59,320
but I have this discussion. It's like, okay, you're allowed 50 milli-seave roots of radiation a year.

1646
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:04,920
We're going to do a CTN, Gegram, and U, but in this facility, it's 2.2 milli-seave roots.

1647
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:08,040
And you're going to pay this amount for it. If you go and do it over there,

1648
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:13,320
it's 18 milli-seave roots and you're going to pay less. Your choice. Great. To me, that makes sense.

1649
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:16,760
So I guess I didn't realize it. I guess I thought it was a bigger problem, but you're saying the data

1650
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:21,480
say that's not an issue. It's a small issue. It's less than three-tenths of one percent of the

1651
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:26,840
overall health care cost crisis. And that's been studied many times, but yet it's vivid and we're

1652
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:31,160
proximate to it as doctors. And to be honest with you, like you say, healthcare has a lot of things

1653
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:36,120
that we don't understand. And here's one thing we see and we understand, and it just seems wrong.

1654
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:42,120
And that's why it's disproportionately dominating the discussion of healthcare costs. The reality is

1655
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:49,240
my malpractice insurance, it's about $40,000 a year as a surgeon at Johns Hopkins. It's been about that

1656
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:56,280
for 25 years, but yet premiums go up seven to 11% a year. For health insurance. For health insurance.

1657
02:27:56,360 --> 02:28:02,040
For what we're spending. So I mean. So if you're going to rank order the things, I mean, you've

1658
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:09,320
pointed out an enormous one. If simply, if bogus discounts in middlemen is 15% of it, that has to

1659
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:13,640
be the single largest item then, isn't it? Well, that's just the pricing failure piece of it. And

1660
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:20,200
that's just an estimation. So then you add to that 21% of healthcare services are unnecessary

1661
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:25,960
according to this survey of 2000 doctors that we did at Hopkins around the country. If they're

1662
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:30,600
saying that 21% of everything we're doing is unnecessary, there is a huge cost reduction

1663
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:36,360
opportunity. If we can focus on appropriateness. What about drug pricing generic versus non-generic?

1664
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:41,720
I mean, that seems to be another place where the United States pays disproportionately more than

1665
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:45,640
anyone else in the world. Yeah, absolutely. Another piece of it. I mean, that's where people are

1666
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:51,640
coming up with the stats that roughly half of our healthcare spend can be chopped off and we can

1667
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:54,920
still deliver high quality healthcare that has better patient outcomes. So what about the

1668
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:59,240
counter argument? Counter argument would say, look, pick your favorite drug. Americans are going

1669
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:03,640
to pay two times more than anybody else. In some cases, much more. I mean, we sometimes use a

1670
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:08,680
Canadian pharmacy for our patients for really expensive drugs, just on principle. It's not that

1671
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:12,520
the patient necessarily can't afford it, but I just say to them, look, I'm morally opposed to the fact

1672
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:18,520
that you're going to pay $30 a pill for something that I know in Canada is a dollar and 97 cents a

1673
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:22,600
pill. And that example is actually true. And if I'm going to give you 300 of these for a year,

1674
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:26,120
I'd much rather you pay two bucks a pill than 30 bucks a pill because your insurance won't cover

1675
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:30,360
this, by the way. The counter argument is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We have to pay more for

1676
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:36,840
drugs as Americans because we're reaping the benefit of drug discovery. All the best drug

1677
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:41,560
discoveries taking place here. These are our companies, which by the way, is not entirely true.

1678
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:46,360
And therefore we subsidize the rest of the world's drug costs because that's the price we pay for

1679
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:50,840
being the innovator. Is that kind of a bogus argument? You're absolutely right. Pharma companies,

1680
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:56,440
when they develop drugs, are factoring in. They're budgeting the profit down the road

1681
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:00,760
into the drug development price. So if there's bigger profits in the US, that's all part of the

1682
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:05,320
investment that they make in the research. The problem with drug pricing is there are so many

1683
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:11,480
moving parts. And what I've seen is, first of all, as a cancer surgeon, some of these drugs do

1684
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:16,680
miracles and save lives. It's just incredible what we're seeing. Biologic agents now are working

1685
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:20,920
wonders in part because it's a whole different generation. These are not small molecules. These

1686
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:27,160
are expensive drugs to develop. They're immune-based medications. Yeah, Ktruda is just unbelievable.

1687
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:31,560
Unbelievable. And it's getting more awesome and we're seeing lives saved. What we're seeing is

1688
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:36,680
a couple bad actors engage in the business of price gouging. We're seeing a couple bad actors

1689
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:43,320
transition from brand to generic by not giving the information to the generic companies. They're

1690
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:48,440
not disclosing it like they should. Normally, you have to disclose when your brand is done all the

1691
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:53,880
manufacturing stuff. You're supposed to disclose it. So they just delay it and they drag. And Scott

1692
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:57,640
Gottlieb, the head of the FDA, has basically said, enough is enough. When your patents are over,

1693
02:30:57,640 --> 02:31:01,320
you've got to turn all this stuff over. You've got to get the generics going right away. If you drag

1694
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:05,640
your feet for a couple years, it's like having a patent for a few more years. Wow. I didn't even

1695
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,200
think of that opportunity to screw people harder. And then you get the PBM middle games,

1696
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:15,960
which the smoke bomb in the PBM world is the rebates. Rebates are when the PBMs or middlemen,

1697
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:20,600
you name it, any of the middle-air say to the pharma companies, and this is where I have a little

1698
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:27,000
sympathy for pharma. If it's okay to say that America today, the PBM say, oh, or group purchasing

1699
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:31,800
organizations. If you want to be in our catalog, our formularies that we make available to our

1700
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:36,920
employees and on the benefits programs we manage or the hospitals that we supply if we're a group

1701
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:41,960
purchasing organization or GPO, pay us a million bucks to be in the catalog. Well, what does the

1702
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:46,120
pharma company do? They pay the million bucks and they build it into the price of the drug.

1703
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:50,840
And then the middleman says, hey, this is a good game. How about 2 million? Sure. Build it into

1704
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:55,720
the price of the drug. How about 50 million and we'll give you exclusive placement in the

1705
02:31:55,720 --> 02:32:00,920
formulary or exclusive placement in our group purchasing catalogs. Numbers directionally,

1706
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:04,360
I mean, are you making these numbers upper? Is that literally what some of the dollar numbers are?

1707
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:11,240
It's literally what they are. And they're not only are they forcing the pharma companies,

1708
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:15,720
device companies also, are being held hostage to these middlemen to say, look, you pay us these

1709
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:20,440
fees or you're not going to be in our catalog. How do you think we had a shortage of saline? I mean,

1710
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:24,840
ask Jill, who's one of the best nurses I've ever worked with at Hopkins, ask her, how do we have

1711
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:31,240
a shortage of saline? It's salt water. Salt. The two most common elements in the world.

1712
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:35,480
Salt and water. How do we have a critical shortage in the price spikes? Why? Because

1713
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:41,240
these middlemen played these play to pay fee games called so-called rebates. They're really kickbacks.

1714
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:47,080
Let's call it what it is. Let's change the lexicon. Pay us these kickbacks to be in our catalog or

1715
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:53,160
pay us a lot of money. You can be the exclusive saline company in our, and then all of a sudden

1716
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:57,800
their supply chain gets so thin. I love the notion of their needing to be exclusive saline provider.

1717
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:02,840
There's something so proprietary about putting sodium in water. The shiny object, they're

1718
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:06,840
floating to the hospitals and the employers just to say. You're going to get the biggest discount.

1719
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:11,320
Oh, we get bulk discounting. Well, you don't even know what the reference price is anymore. There's

1720
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:17,320
only one company making it. And so they figured out this game. Now the game is very profitable

1721
02:33:17,320 --> 02:33:23,000
for the, I call it a rich man's game. It's very profitable for everybody. Except the last guy

1722
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:27,400
holding the bag. The patient. I mean, the hospitals are even getting a share back sometimes.

1723
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:32,840
These rebates are basically kickbacks. And I've argued to every single politician I get in front

1724
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:35,880
of, which is a lot of them. And I can tell you, I've met with a lot of people in the Trump

1725
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:41,960
administration even last week. And I've told them we need to eliminate all kickbacks in healthcare.

1726
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:47,960
It's time we ban all kickbacks. Is that a policy issue? Was that a legal issue or is that a market

1727
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:56,040
issue? It's two issues. One, it's a policy issue. In 1987, law was passed to give PBMs and GPOs,

1728
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:03,480
or it gave PBMs and GPOs exclusivity. So the Sherman Antitrust Act does not apply to this supply

1729
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:07,640
chain. I'm glad you bring that up because I was just about to say that sounds like antitrust. We

1730
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:13,960
certainly wouldn't allow that in any other industry. How bad is it that those middlemen, PBMs,

1731
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:21,320
GPOs have benefited from a law that was passed, which gave them so-called exclusivity to the

1732
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:25,560
Sherman Antitrust Act? It's called the Safe Harbor. And you'll see a lot of us writing about it. You'll

1733
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:29,320
see a lot of it in the policy discussions. Let's get rid of the Safe Harbor. Let's get rid of

1734
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:33,800
kickbacks in healthcare. Okay. So to fix any problem, you have to immediately understand

1735
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:41,320
who's going to be hurt by this situation, leaving its status quo. Surely there must be an army of

1736
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:45,960
lobbyists that have no interest in anything you're talking about. They don't want any safe

1737
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:50,760
harbors being revoked. They don't want any middlemen going away. And despite the fact that at the

1738
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:56,920
individual level, I believe many of these people are disgusted by the profession, in the end as a

1739
02:34:56,920 --> 02:35:02,680
group, you stand up for what you have and you stand up for your livelihood. So it seems to me one of

1740
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:09,320
the biggest challenges is, okay, Marty is a voice of opposition to this, but the people who are being

1741
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:15,880
hurt the most, which with every human out there, every person in this country, that is, they're not

1742
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:21,240
collective. They're sort of like, I'm one guy and I got my bill and I'm getting screwed. And you're

1743
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:24,840
one guy and you're fighting with a collections agency and you're one woman and you got breast

1744
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:29,240
cancer and you got these guys riding shotgun up your butt and blah, blah, blah, blah. But there's

1745
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:33,720
no one that brings them together. So it's sort of like you have an industry complex, a machine

1746
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:40,280
that is very easily able to diffuse a bunch of one-off attacks. That strikes me as to me the

1747
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:44,280
biggest single problem here. It's not the structural problem within the system. There are

1748
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:49,560
relatively straightforward ideas that can be tested and iterated on. The problem is, how do

1749
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:55,400
you create the inertia for change when the people who have to force change at the individual level

1750
02:35:55,400 --> 02:36:02,040
have less to gain than the collective entity does to lose? That's, I mean, not to be depressing,

1751
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:09,320
but that strikes me as the problem here. But the exciting thing is that young people, millennials,

1752
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:15,240
doctors, senior physicians that have been in practice who see propofol in sudden shortage,

1753
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:19,080
people who understand there's money games and there's stuff that's going on that shouldn't be

1754
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:24,040
happening, they're standing up, they're organizing. I mean, look how this has got to be grassroots.

1755
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:28,120
I mean, it's grassroots. And you know what's awesome is this is our heritage. This is the

1756
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:33,880
medical profession. This is who we are as doctors. We're advocates for our patients. That's who we

1757
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:39,880
are. It's in our blood. I mean, when Dr. Sabin invented the polio vaccine, they told him, all

1758
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:45,320
his colleagues told him and these business guys, you need to get a patent on this because this could

1759
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:49,960
be the biggest moneymaker in the world. He said, no, this is the property of humanity. I want as

1760
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:56,440
many people to get this as possible. There are estimates of what Salk forfeited by not 8 billion.

1761
02:36:56,440 --> 02:37:02,520
Forbes estimated 8 billion dollars of that day. That was 1954, a year when 20,000 people were

1762
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:08,840
living in an iron lung machine. You talk about a horrible disease. And he said, this is a gift to

1763
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:13,640
mankind. This will be disseminated as broadly as possible. And it's probably one of the greatest

1764
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:18,600
and most inspiring stories. That guy's a hero. That is medicine. That's who we are. I mean,

1765
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:23,880
when Benjamin Rush, one of the five physician signers of the Declaration of Independence,

1766
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:28,280
had his practice his entire life. He took care of patients with schizophrenia

1767
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:34,280
and he de-stigmatized mental illness. So it wasn't seen as demon possession. His patients were

1768
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:39,400
chained to buildings. They had no money. Mental illness meant you were impoverished. He took care

1769
02:37:39,400 --> 02:37:44,440
of those patients. He was a role model. He was one of our greatest leaders in society. President

1770
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:49,720
Adams says, you know, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Benjamin Rush both had great contributions

1771
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:56,280
to mankind, but Benjamin Rush had more and they were greater. And that's our heritage. I mean,

1772
02:37:56,280 --> 02:38:02,040
that is who we are. That's who my dad was as he took care of cancer patients. He's now retired.

1773
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:06,760
He would never treat a patient and then destroy their FICA score with surprise bills.

1774
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:13,080
We have this incredible heritage of being patient advocates. And if we can channel 1% of the energy

1775
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:20,280
we spend on lobbying for higher doctor pay in Washington, D.C. into being the champions of fair

1776
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:25,960
and honest transparent pricing, we're going to see this incredible public trust come back because I

1777
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:31,560
worry and I'd love your thoughts on this, but I really worry we are seeing the public trust eroded

1778
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:38,920
by this medical money game billing predatory game that's going on. I'm from central Pennsylvania,

1779
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,640
a town called Danville. The Amish people are very close to that area. We have more men and I

1780
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:49,560
closer to our region. The Amish people, when someone gets a serious illness, half the time

1781
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:57,800
they take an Amtrak train for five days to Mexico because the medical care there has honest and fair

1782
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:03,080
transparent pricing. They're worried about getting price gouged in the hospitals locally. What's that

1783
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:07,960
say about our country? I mean, you get on the Amtrak train in Pittsburgh where the Amtrak from Lancaster

1784
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:14,120
connects with the train that goes cross country. It is mostly Amish people going to Mexico for breast

1785
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:20,200
cancer surgery, for a chronic disease therapy, for a medication. What's that say? It says people are

1786
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:25,160
hungry for honest and transparent pricing like Keith Smith has in Oklahoma City. That's what I'm

1787
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:30,040
hearing you say is, look, physicians aren't the reason that this system is broken, but now the

1788
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:36,440
onus is on them to play a role in catalyzing reform because by association, whether we like it or not,

1789
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:41,240
we're now a part of the problem. And it's so proximate to us. We interact all the time. When

1790
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:48,600
I show the egregious bills or stories of individuals harmed by these bills or they're paying more on

1791
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:52,600
their mortgage because their FICA score was destroyed from a balanced bill from an epidural,

1792
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:59,240
the hospital executives are very understanding. I mean, they I think sometimes just don't know how

1793
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:04,120
far the revenue cycle or billing outsourced departments, how aggressive they've gone.

1794
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:09,560
And if you appeal to everyday human instinct, they will say, yeah, this does not seem right.

1795
02:40:09,560 --> 02:40:15,240
We are very close to our hospital leaders in medicine. We need to say, okay, here's a couple

1796
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:20,760
things that hospital code of conduct. We can get our act together and provide one honest transparent

1797
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:26,200
bill that's not jacked up for discounts. We can agree we will never sue a patient that's low income

1798
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:31,160
and came in for basic medical care. We can agree that if we're going to bill a patient directly,

1799
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:35,880
we'll use the Medicare allowable amounts. We're not angry when Medicare pays us. We

1800
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:39,080
shouldn't be angry if somebody pays us the Medicare allowable amount.

1801
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:43,480
That's a great idea, Marty. Is there such a code of conduct that's being generated and signed off on?

1802
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:47,800
This to me sounds like a great first step. And there's no order to these steps that can be done

1803
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:55,320
in parallel. But I think you could rattle off 10 things that 90 percent of physicians and hospital

1804
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:59,320
administrators would look at and go, yeah, I believe in like everything you just said. Who

1805
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:03,640
wouldn't agree to those principles and potentially seven more? Is that in the works?

1806
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:08,600
Yeah, my students have put it up at restoringmedicine.org, a basic code of conduct for

1807
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:14,200
medical centers. But it's not just docs. It's not just medical professionals. I have people

1808
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:19,000
all the time, everyday folks, if I speak to a conference of say real estate agents and we get

1809
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:24,360
into all these issues, they'll often say, and I want to do something, what can I do? And I tell

1810
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:29,960
them, get involved in your local hospital. It is a community organization. It's a nonprofit with

1811
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:35,960
a public mission. And ask these questions. How do you manage patients who can't pay? If they're

1812
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:41,160
deductible is high and they get a bill or they're uninsured, how do you bill? What's your average

1813
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:48,840
markup? Is it 1.5? Is it 2.5? Is it 23, like we found in some of our research? What is your

1814
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:54,040
average markup defined as how much do you charge above the Medicare allowable amount? We did get

1815
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:59,640
the Trump administration. I was very impressed. SEMA Verma, Alex Azar, Kelly, I mean, incredible

1816
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:03,560
folks that basically said, yeah, we get it when it comes to fair pricing. We want every hospital

1817
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:08,280
to submit their prices. And they did that January 1. It's a first step. It's a first step. These are

1818
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:13,640
jacked up prices. We got to get the real prices. But everyday folks want to know what to do. I

1819
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:18,120
tell them, find out what your hospital's average markup. How do they handle bills that are not

1820
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:23,400
paid among low income, insured and uninsured people? Reach out to your local courthouse. Find

1821
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:28,280
out if they're suing the socks off of the town, like we've seen in 20% of hospitals in the state

1822
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:34,040
of Virginia. And then reach out to your board members and ask them, engage them on the subject.

1823
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:38,840
And the hospital board members, it's always the president of the local bank. It's always a couple

1824
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:43,480
business leaders. They're always reasonable people. They come in. I'm on a hospital board. I got a

1825
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:48,360
meeting later today. Anne Arundel Medical Center. It's at the big hospital in Annapolis, Maryland.

1826
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:53,560
These are good people. Appeal to those people and say, look, we want to take this code of conduct

1827
02:42:53,560 --> 02:43:00,280
seriously. We want to be a hospital that provides roughly 6% of our services as charity care,

1828
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:05,240
disclosed upfront to the patient. Not, we shake you down and whatever we can't get.

1829
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:06,920
Whatever we can't get, we deem charity.

1830
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:12,680
We deem charity, which is the standard way of doing business. 6%, charity, honest pricing,

1831
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:18,760
honest billing practices. Those are things we can engage our community board members on.

1832
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:22,600
That's the purpose of writing this book, the price we pay. You know, when you write a book,

1833
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:28,600
especially as a doctor, maybe especially even as a surgeon, some people who don't like this message

1834
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:32,840
will ascribe to you. And I know you're working on a book. People will ascribe, oh, they're

1835
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:38,040
self-promoting. They're just doing this for self-promotion. What's known among authors is the books

1836
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:42,600
don't make money. You don't make them for the time you spend. I mean, I make a lot more money

1837
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:47,720
just doing surgery. But this is a way of getting the message out there and to engage people and

1838
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:50,840
to say, hey, this is what's happening and this is what we can do about it.

1839
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:54,840
Well, Marty, I know you do have to get down to Annapolis today. So I guess we'll bring this to

1840
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:58,840
a close. I think there are a lot of things here. It's sort of overwhelming. As I said, I can't

1841
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:04,840
really think of a machine that I find more confusing than the US healthcare system. And that,

1842
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:09,080
in general, probably isn't a good thing. I hope that you're right. I mean, I gotta be honest with

1843
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:16,440
you. I'm concerned that the force necessary to overcome the inertia is so great that we need a

1844
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:21,560
bigger crisis because in the end, we'll do things until we can't do them anymore. We always talk

1845
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:25,400
about, well, this isn't sustainable. Well, technically it is because we're still doing it.

1846
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:31,560
What does it take for this to not become sustainable? I don't know. But I love your

1847
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:37,720
message that doctors need to sort of get involved in this a little bit because by proxy,

1848
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:41,560
we are involved in it, whether we want to be or not. So you take that example of a woman,

1849
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:46,200
if you provide care to this woman with breast cancer and you're doing the best you can,

1850
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:51,560
and you don't realize that a year later, she's getting shaken down for medical bills, well,

1851
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:55,320
you can say, well, I didn't have anything to do with that. And it's true you didn't,

1852
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:59,320
but do you also have an obligation to her? And if the answer to that question is yes,

1853
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:04,440
then I think that doctors and patients alike can probably overcome what you're describing.

1854
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:08,760
I hope that turns out to be the case. I'm seeing some exciting things. I mean, right now, I think

1855
02:45:08,760 --> 02:45:15,480
the American people are prioritizing this problem as the number one problem in America. When the

1856
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:21,320
LA Times reporter, Noam Levy, tells me that more Americans are making different choices at the

1857
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:27,320
supermarket. They're cutting their vacations and they no longer have money to save for their kids.

1858
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:31,560
And sometimes their FICA scores are getting destroyed all because of surprise medical

1859
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:37,480
bills or inflated bills. This is saying, and he's saying, this is going to be the number one issue

1860
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:42,600
in the election. This is the number one issue for the American public. And my goal is how can we

1861
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:46,840
educate people? I'm never going to run for office. I mean, I've thought about running for president

1862
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:53,240
simply on one issue of banning all plastic surgery because I go to Florida a lot. You know,

1863
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:59,640
it's the evolutionary reflex of a human being identifying another species and being frightened,

1864
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:03,160
you know, like a kid, you know, if a kid sees someone ugly, they don't jump, but if they see

1865
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:07,640
someone with all this plastic, they are startled and it's sort of the natural selection of

1866
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:13,000
identifying foreign species. But this is something that is imminently fixable. We're seeing employers

1867
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,400
now saying, I want independent brokers and consultants renegotiating my PBMs that don't

1868
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:20,920
take kickbacks. There's a group of them. There's not a lot. We put them on the website, restoring

1869
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:25,000
medicine. Give me all the resources. So where can someone go if they want to know how to find an

1870
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:30,440
independent versus on kickback broker? So health Rosetta is started by Dave Chase. And what he's

1871
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:35,640
done is tried to create a brand of sort of the free trade brokers, if you will, that is those

1872
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:41,000
people that have agreed to a code of conduct and it's all transparent and you feel it's worth

1873
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:45,400
getting a second. So that's health Rosetta.com. The whole throws that if you Google health Rosetta

1874
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:50,440
comes up, we're putting a link to it on our resource. What's your resource? Restoring medicine.org.

1875
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:55,480
And we're trying to generate some interest. The students created the website. I put a post on

1876
02:46:55,480 --> 02:47:00,920
there that showed the prices of everything in America and prices of hospital services,

1877
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:06,120
which was crazy off the charts compared to everything else in society. And this thing,

1878
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:12,680
I just posted it got, I don't know, 70 likes in a day and share 70 shares in a day. I don't know

1879
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:18,200
if I have 70 friends. I realized like people are connecting with this issue that we can do better.

1880
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:24,200
So that's restoring medicine. Restoring medicine.org basically can point people in the direction of all

1881
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:28,600
of the things you're talking about here. Yeah. And also I've got a website, Marty MD.com,

1882
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:32,840
where I try to provide some resources for folks that are interested in learning more about this.

1883
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:36,920
All right. And the price we pay comes out exactly when they're still floating the date,

1884
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:40,840
but it's going to come out when they line it up with the media, but it'll be very soon.

1885
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:45,240
All right. Well, Marty, thank you so much, man. Awesome to get to hang with you two days in a row.

1886
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:49,320
Great to be with you, Peter. It's just so awesome to see what you're doing, educating people and

1887
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:54,680
promoting good health and reeducating us. And I'd like to see some humility from the American

1888
02:47:54,680 --> 02:48:00,440
Heart Association just to say, we're sorry, we got it horribly wrong, but I think it's going to be

1889
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:06,040
individuals like you that just say, Hey, stuff I was taught is now outdated and this is the new

1890
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:09,640
science. So thanks for pushing us on that. Well, I'll tell you, that seems like a much easier

1891
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:12,600
problem to sort of be working on than the one you're working on. So I think you are actually

1892
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:16,200
working on the single most important problem in all of medicine. And I don't say that lightly

1893
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:20,360
because I think there are a lot of problems in medicine, but if we don't get this one fixed

1894
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:24,920
soon, we're going to be in, I think, the degree of pain that most people can't fathom from an

1895
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:30,680
economic sense. Great to be with you, Peter. Great to see you, man. You can find all of this
