00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Attia drive. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,000
The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,400
more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:43,480
and other topics at PeterAttiaMD.com. Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of the drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,520
listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about professionally

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,800
are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
this topic. I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,360
basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
and sharing this knowledge is not easy. And even before starting the podcast, that became clear to

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,920
is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this? As you probably know,

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,520
the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads. But after a lot of contemplation, that model just

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,200
by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,400
me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,880
it enthusiastically. So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
This keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange,

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple. It's my

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,400
goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,080
than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,320
including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,560
our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Anything episodes. That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about,

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,880
I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said,

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,200
we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,920
pass savings on to you. Again, the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,960
you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,680
for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,720
moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce,

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,720
My guest this week is Dr. Ronesh Sinha. Ronesh, who really goes by Ron, is an internist in the

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,480
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, and he created a South Asian medical consultant service for his

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,720
medical group in Silicon Valley. I connected with Ron about five years ago, and I think we talked

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,640
about this at the very beginning of the podcast, largely because I was running up against some brick

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,360
walls and taking care of some of my South Asian patients at the time and seeing just a different

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,280
pattern of metabolic illness. When I was introduced to Ron and got familiar with his books,

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,760
we just basically began a friendship at that time, although interestingly, this was the first time

53
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,800
we met in person to record this podcast. It was an interesting experience feeling you know somebody,

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,480
but then you for the first time get to sit down with them. It was great. We just had a really

55
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,760
interesting discussion about a number of topics. Obviously, we focus a lot on what hyperinsulinemia,

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,400
insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, all these things look like in his

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,440
patient population, but his patient population is basically a model system that allows you to

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,240
understand lots of patients. So if you're listening to this as someone who takes care of patients with

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,800
insulin resistance, or if you yourself have any of the things that go along with this high blood

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,760
pressure, insulin resistance, you're overweight, all these things. In many ways, this is a really

61
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,040
great podcast to go into the how to address these things with respect to, you know, we talk about

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
everything from nutrition to sleep, et cetera. I would say one of the things about this podcast

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,960
that was a totally pleasant surprise was the part of the discussion that we ended at, which is

64
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,920
Ron's really interesting and unique purview into what's happening in Silicon Valley with respect to

65
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,360
stress and with respect to how that is trickling down into kids. And in fact, you know, something

66
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,920
he said to me at the very end after we would, we had stopped recording, but we were sitting around

67
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,000
talking and this is often the case where you have these amazing discussions 10 minutes after you turn

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,280
the mic off. And he said something to the effect of, you know, I just can't believe at how little

69
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,160
happiness exists in the Silicon Valley. And he wasn't making a general statement of like,

70
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,080
you cross the board. He was saying, look, I take care of patients who work for

71
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,280
some of the greatest companies in the world by whatever metric we would, you know, make that claim

72
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,200
financially or whatever. And he said, and yet it's kind of amazing how unhappy and stressed out so

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,640
many of these people are. And you can see it in their lives because that's sort of something

74
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,000
about Ron's practice that's pretty unique is he takes care of whole families across generations.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,640
And he sort of gets to see things that certainly I don't get to see and that I think many patients

76
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,600
or rather many physicians don't. So I think this podcast is going to be something worth

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,640
listening to if you have any interest in metabolic health, but also this last part that we talk about

78
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,080
with respect to kids and with respect to maybe some of the things that those of us that have kids

79
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,720
could do better. Certainly something that I took a lot away from that discussion. And I actually

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,200
look forward to trying to implement a number of the suggestions that Ron made. So I hope you'll

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:24,760
enjoy my discussion with Dr. Ron Sinha. Hey Ron, thanks for making the trip up to San Francisco

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,000
today. It is great to be here. I know we chatted a few years ago, but it's finally great to meet you

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,920
face to face. I know. And I was sort of joking before. What is the commute from Los Altos up

84
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,720
to San Francisco today? So today it took me a good little bit less than an hour. Yeah. That's

85
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,200
incredible. Right. You could take two and a half hours if you time it wrong, right? Exactly right.

86
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,280
Yeah. It's funny because on the weekends when you drive off hours, you realize the barrier is

87
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,760
actually a very small place, but with traffic, it feels extensive. So yeah. Yeah. I think we won't

88
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,720
get into the who has worse traffic, LA, San Francisco, New York. Right. Right. No, this is

89
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,920
really cool. This is the first time we've met in person, but I do feel like I kind of know you just

90
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,640
through so many emails and discussions over the last five years. And you pointed out that Mark

91
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,720
Sisson introduced us, which I had totally forgotten. I had lost track of how we actually connected in

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,040
the first place. And I actually have been remiss in needing to catch up with Mark Sisson as well.

93
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,640
I don't think I've seen Mark in probably about three or four years. Yeah. And he's enjoying

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,000
Southern California right now. I think he's... See, I thought he even moved. Oh, no, no, you're

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,880
right. I'm sorry. He actually moved to Florida. Yeah. Yeah. So I think what originally connected

96
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:34,600
us was I had a patient from India who had an unusually stubborn case of insulin resistance,

97
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,960
and it came with a slightly different phenotype. And it wasn't just one patient. I think it was

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,040
probably two patients. And there was something about it that looked a little different from the

99
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,240
usual hyperinsulinemia that I had seen. And it was the impressive degree of inflammation that

100
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,120
accompanied it. I believe that is what initially led me to your book and then to you. So before we

101
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,440
get into that sort of stuff, maybe tell us a little bit about what you do medically, how you

102
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,280
got to where you've got, and eventually, I guess, why you're interested in this particular problem.

103
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Absolutely. So I'd say about 16 years ago when I came out of medical training,

104
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,160
I came to the Bay Area. And in medical training, when we talked about diabetes and cardiovascular

105
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,280
disease, the types of case studies we did were typically older African Americans, Caucasians,

106
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,600
or smoking, eating red meat, sort of that phenotype. And I get to basically the Bay Area,

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,200
and I start seeing patients. And my clinic at that point was pretty much proximal to a lot of

108
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,560
Silicon Valley companies. And I started seeing a ton of people of East Asian and particularly South

109
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,080
Asian background that were coming in with really early diabetes and with wicked family histories

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,080
of diabetes and heart disease and almost every family member. And this is something I never knew

111
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,280
about, Peter, I kind of read anecdotally about this, but I didn't realize that this was such a

112
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,680
common manifestation. And then as I started digging more into the research, I realized when

113
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,960
you look at the UK and Canada, there is unprecedented amounts of diabetes and early heart disease in

114
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,600
these patients. So what I realized at that time was there was a huge gap because we didn't have

115
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,160
any good resources to really help these patients. I mean, you can't give an Indian vegetarian diagram

116
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,680
of the Mediterranean food pyramid, that's not going to be very useful for them. So at that point,

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,600
I sort of made a commitment that I'm going to create some educational materials, nutrition

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,840
that's kind of focused on this population. But incidentally, at that time too, while I followed

119
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,080
my own advice, I watched myself develop metabolic syndrome. And at this point, I was lecturing to

120
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
companies about healthy lifestyles. A lot of them are asking me to come out and talk to our Indian

121
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,760
patients about why they're developing these conditions. And frankly, at that time, I felt

122
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,280
like kind of a fraud because here I'm giving the advice and I see my triglyceride shoot up to above

123
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,040
300, my HDLs in the 20s, my ratios are way elevated. I'm like, what's going on here? And

124
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,560
at that point, I sort of stepped outside of nutritional guidelines and looked at, okay,

125
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,920
really the root cause here is insulin resistance. I can't just provide a one stop sort of meal plan

126
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,760
for all these patients. I've got to do some deeper research. What advice were you giving

127
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,160
at that point in time that you felt you weren't able to follow or even if you were following it,

128
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,400
it wasn't working. I was really following more of a low fat, low cholesterol caloric based model

129
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,560
because that's all I basically knew. I knew a little bit about carbohydrate restriction

130
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,880
and those types of approaches, but I didn't really see that as being a meaningful way to approach it.

131
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,320
And really at that time, I was following everything to the tee five days a week,

132
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,400
eating the right types of diet. Were you vegetarian also? No, no. So I'm from

133
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,120
Bengal from North India. So we eat red meat, we eat fish. That's a stable part of our diet. So

134
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,880
I wasn't, but still eating a lot of sort of the healthy starches at that time and recommending

135
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,800
that the patients as well. And you bring up a key point because at least half of my patients

136
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,520
were vegetarian Indians. And I noticed some of the most significant lipoprotein abnormalities in

137
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,680
those patients really unprecedented diabetes. So I was like, what's going on here? These guys are

138
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,160
eating the Indian vegetarian diet. Why are they so sick and so inflamed? Like you pointed out with

139
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,880
your initial case. So I know exactly what you're referring to. You feel like why am I doing all

140
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,840
this stuff correctly and it's not working? So was there kind of a, aha moment or was it more of a

141
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,240
gradual tinkering that you did? It was gradual tinkering with my case. So basically playing

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,320
around with the macronutrient composition of my meals and sort of following my numbers. At that

143
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,440
time, what I was doing is I was tracking my triglycerides every two to three weeks basically

144
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,440
after making changes. And that's something I do with patients is I check at least their trigs

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,000
once a month while making changes to see how they respond. And it was amazing because as I was doing

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,880
with this with my first few patients who had high triglycerides in some cases for over a decade,

147
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,040
within weeks we'd make some simple changes and see dramatic numbers, which you're familiar with.

148
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,720
But at that time it was on inspiring to realize that, wow, I don't have to put them on vibrates

149
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,720
and fish oil. I can just make a few tweaks to their breakfast and lunch and see these dramatic

150
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,800
improvements in triglycerides and HDL as well. How significant were these changes? What kind

151
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,040
of reductions were you seeing in the triglycerides? Within three to four weeks, we would see drops of

152
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,800
150 points easily because their carbohydrate intake, my average South Asian patients, the vegetarians,

153
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,240
300 to 400 plus grams of carbohydrate per day. Some of my East Asians were eating upwards of

154
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,720
500 to 600 grams, which is pretty typical in areas of urban China and things. So it's really off the

155
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,400
scales when you think of the staple amount of carbohydrates you're taking in. Now, it's, I

156
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,600
think, a little counterintuitive perhaps to a listener and probably to your patients at the time

157
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,960
because triglycerides sounds like fat. How would you explain to them the relationship between

158
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,760
carbohydrate and fat in that capacity? Really good point. And I think that's the most difficult

159
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,440
thing because when they have high triglycerides, the general health information they look at is,

160
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,920
well, triglycerides are blood fat and blood fat is going to be reduced by eating a low fat diet.

161
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,640
But that's where basically in my clinic, I would show them the diagram of insulin. Basically,

162
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I'd show them the glucose sort of parking lot and glucose molecule and show the hormonal

163
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,120
mechanisms of how glucose is basically converted into triglycerides within fat tissue. So I wouldn't

164
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,200
go into details, but I basically show them the conversion. And now what I've developed is a lot

165
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,120
of animations that sort of show this process because a lot of people, it's very tough for them

166
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,360
to logistically understand how that conversion happens. And unless they bind to that concept,

167
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,960
it's very tough for them to just reduce the carbohydrates and be liberal about their fat

168
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,480
intake. So how many African American patients were you taking care of at that time? African

169
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,800
American patients at that time. So interestingly, when I was in Southern California, quite a few,

170
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,600
but here in the Bay Area, a handful at most. Yeah. You I'm sure saw the stark contrast, which is

171
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,800
African American patients can have type two diabetes, frank diabetes, and yet have normal

172
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,440
triglycerides. Yes. Quite common. Right. Did that throw a bit of a wrench in your understanding of

173
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,600
the system? A little bit it did. That's when I started looking at these patients more from a

174
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,400
body sort of a habitist type standpoint. And I started to realize it with my South Asian patients,

175
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,000
one thing that's very common in them is they have very slender limbs, legs and arms are very skinny.

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,760
And compared to my African American patients or others that develop instant resistance,

177
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,480
they've got much more leg mask and much more lean body mass. And I think that lean body mass does

178
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,960
provide them with the ability to process and burn those triglycerides for energy more effectively.

179
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Whereas with my South Asians, they have such a high degree of the visceral fat. And when you

180
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,000
look at cross sections of African Americans, Caucasians and South Asians, when you look at

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,720
the ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat, it's remarkable what the ratios are like. And that's

182
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,760
why South Asians and East Asians develop such acute inflammation and some resistance at low

183
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,840
body weights because a proportion of that visceral fat is significantly higher. So take a moment to

184
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,880
explain to people the difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat. Sure. So when you think

185
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,360
about those two types of fat, I actually like to think of it in three zones. So basically, you've

186
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,000
got what we call the SCAT, the superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue, you've got the

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,480
DSCAT, which is the deeper layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue just right underneath the skin.

188
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,520
And then you've got the visceral fat. And the way I explain it to people is think of

189
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,920
sort of a city versus a suburb. So the subcutaneous fat is really out in the suburbs,

190
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,880
the superficial, the deep is a little bit further in. So this could be basically South San Francisco

191
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,880
and the visceral is basically around the organs. And the way I explain it like that is because

192
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,680
with the suburban fat, you're basically you've got fat cells and you've got fat structures that are

193
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,320
more lobulated and organized kind of like a track home or strip mall type out in the suburbs.

194
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,240
And they don't have much access to the blood supply. When you get deeper into the layers of

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,880
the deep subcutaneous fat and the visceral fat, what happens is it's more loosely organized,

196
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,720
it's not as lobulated, but they've got direct access to the liver and the bloodstream. And

197
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,720
that's really important. When we think about subcutaneous fat, often people think, Oh my God,

198
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,040
I hate my subcutaneous fat, but really, this subcutaneous fat, it's a safety belt for us.

199
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,800
When you have larger subcutaneous fat stores, it insulates you and protects you from having fat

200
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,840
spill into those visceral fat stores. So as much as my female patients complain about subcutaneous

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,440
fat, I'm like, this is actually a safety belt for me because we don't want this fat to get into the

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,040
inner city. As we get to the visceral fat, the other thing you want to be aware of is the concept

203
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,240
of transmembrane flux. And what I mean by that is the fatty acids that flow inside and outside of

204
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,000
fat cells in subcutaneous fat, it's relatively inert. So you might get some fatty acid flux,

205
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,680
you don't get many inflammatory chemicals that come out of that fat. But as you go into the

206
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,200
inner city fat, the visceral fat, there's all types of cross traffic happening. You've got

207
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,600
inflammatory mediators, your usual adipokines, inflammatory chemicals, and you've got a lot of

208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,120
free fatty acids going back and forth. So when you see patients of that body habitus, you realize

209
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,480
that even though they don't have much subcutaneous fat, they've got quite a bit of visceral. And

210
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,480
the interesting thing is I see a lot of couples. So when I see Indian couples, it's very obvious,

211
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,920
it's very interesting how the women are obviously sometimes 30 to 40 pounds overweight,

212
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,080
but their metabolic numbers look flawless, triglycerides, HDL, everything looks great.

213
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,480
The husbands are real thin and skinny. And you would think that their numbers would look good,

214
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,000
but their numbers are much more off the charts basically. And it's because they don't have as

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,080
much of that subcutaneous fat insulation, everything's going directly to visceral fat.

216
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,160
And so this is one of the great holes in the notion of using something as simple as a body

217
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,680
mass index calculator, which probably directionally makes sense if you're looking at a very

218
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,520
homogeneous population of Caucasians, but starts to really fall apart in both East and South Asians.

219
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,800
In fact, it's probably East and South Asians in which this term skinny fat was probably first

220
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,280
derived. And so in the example you just gave, the hypothetical wife in that situation gets the

221
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,040
traditional label of, oh, she's fat. But as you point out, she's not really metabolically in

222
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,320
trouble. She's not at an increased risk of diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

223
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,480
NAFLD or any of these other things. But aesthetically, of course, she would love to be

224
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,320
more thin. Her husband, by contrast, looks fine, aside from the fact that he doesn't have any

225
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,160
muscle mass. But it turns out he's metabolically, at least according to the data, probably in worse

226
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,040
shape than the overweight individual who has comparable metabolic markers. There's actually

227
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,040
a study by Mitch Lazar, and maybe this is no longer the case. Maybe this has been updated,

228
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,960
but the last time I really looked at these data, there was a paper in Science that looked at these

229
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:48,360
four phenotypes. So external versus internal. So you had lean versus not lean and metabolically

230
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,600
well versus not well. So that gives you a two by two. So there are four categories. So

231
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,160
let's just posit that the best case scenario is to be lean and metabolically well. And when you

232
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,080
looked at the outcomes of all of these, the worst outcomes were in the lean individuals who were

233
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,080
metabolically ill. They actually did worse in the overweight individuals who were metabolically

234
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,240
ill. And I talked with Mitch about this quite a while ago. I mean, this paper is actually quite

235
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,920
old now that I think about it. It's probably 2014. But the question I asked was, is it possible that

236
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,520
it's their inability to actually shunt and store some of that excess energy into a safer depot

237
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,080
of fat, as you point out, that is actually their undoing? And at the time, I think that was sort

238
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,400
of Mitch's view. That sounds like you share that view. Oh, I do for sure. I mean, if we think of

239
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,800
this tissue overflow hypothesis, where if you think of it as a watershed type thing, it's

240
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,240
subcutaneous to deep subcutaneous to visceral. I've actually putting females aside, I've seen a

241
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,080
lot of overweight South Asians where I would expect in the early days that they'd have numbers

242
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,880
that are proportionally worse, but they're actually not that bad. And so my theory around that, and

243
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,000
based on that study too, is they have larger subcutaneous fat stores to insulate them. On top

244
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,520
of that, the other thing that's very unique about their body morphology is again, I look at their

245
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,040
legs, their legs are more muscular because they're carrying around a lot more weight, they've got

246
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,760
larger thighs, larger calves. So I think the combination of the increased insulation from the

247
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,400
subcutaneous fat and the elevated muscle stores from the legs is probably helping metabolize those

248
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,840
lipids better. But when I see those real skinny, we're talking BMIs of 21, now I look at them,

249
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,120
I can literally predict their triglycerides. I'm like, this is probably through the roof,

250
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,520
because everything is in that visceral store compartment. So and then how closely do you see

251
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,280
that association of where their triglycerides are to some of their glycemic numbers? In other

252
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,320
words, can you look at that and get a sense of where they are on the spectrum towards having type

253
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,360
two diabetes? That's really interesting. So I see a lot of discordance in my population. So I see

254
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,720
a lot of them that will come in with the triglycerides. And maybe because I'm catching them at

255
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,040
the early stage, I don't necessarily see the glycemic impact of that. And they might be 10 to

256
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,320
15 years away from that. Yes, I absolutely get the ones that come in with full blown pre diabetes or

257
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,400
type two diabetes and triglycerides. But I'd say the majority of the population that I see,

258
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,120
they've already got fatty liver, they've got high triglycerides, but their glucose looks fine.

259
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,280
And that is a really important population to really educate because I'm telling them now that

260
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,320
you don't have pre diabetes, you have pre pre diabetes. And this is where we can make the most

261
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,040
impact at this stage, because you've probably got some preserved beta cell function, you've got some

262
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,760
compensatory hyperinsulinemia that's overcoming that. But if we can really make a move here and

263
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,200
just knowing that they have pre pre diabetes, because they all have like at least one family

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
member that has diabetes. So that's the one condition they don't want. But they've never had

265
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,160
a doctor that's taken kind of a non glycemic diagnosis of diabetes where your glucose is

266
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,000
normal, you're fine. No, it's your triglycerides. And even before that, it's just your darn waste

267
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,920
circumference. And can we actually attack it at that point and go from there? And what about the

268
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:53,320
hyperinsulinemia? Do you see in those patients normal glucose, but elevated postprandial insulin?

269
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,080
So I got to be honest with you in saying that so in the early days, I was checking those numbers

270
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,480
quite a bit. And I would see that I do insulin and glucose tolerance tests. And I'd see that I'm

271
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,480
probably not checking that as often now. But when I do check it, usually their fasting insulin at

272
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,640
least is off the charts. So definitely they've got signs of early hyperinsulinemia. Yeah,

273
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,480
like I wish I could take a sabbatical for a year from life. Because I know we've gone over this,

274
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,440
we've even talked about this a little bit through email. I really feel like I'm trying to coalesce

275
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,200
around, I hate the term because it sounds so stupid, but a unifying theory of metabolic disease.

276
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,040
Of course, the problem is in physics, unifying theories are very neat. And in biology, by

277
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,920
definition, they're anything but unifying. So it's actually kind of ironic that we would use the term

278
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,320
because by definition, it's bootstrapped together with, well, there's this subset and this subset

279
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,680
and this subset. And sometimes you can get a combination of these two. And sometimes it's

280
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,240
these two. But there are these different phenotypes. I mean, there's no denying the normal

281
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,880
triglyceride, normal LFT person who for some reason is not getting fat accumulation in the

282
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,320
liver and therefore doesn't seem to have an excess of fat efflux from the liver. But they're already

283
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,840
on the way to diabetes, if not already having diabetes. By the way, part of the problem is I

284
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,800
don't really like the definition of diabetes. I don't really like the definition of type two

285
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,480
diabetes today. I don't think that the hemoglobin A1C is particularly helpful. So this is my soapbox.

286
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,840
So there's two issues I have with it. One, now that about a third of my patients are using CGM

287
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,480
and it's being calibrated. So we're using the Dexcom because it's much more accurate than the

288
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,440
Libra and it can be force calibrated. So even though the FDA says it doesn't need to be calibrated,

289
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,760
you can still force a calibration twice a day. So you get really accurate readings. When you put

290
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,200
these things on patients for 90 days, you actually find out what their average blood glucose is.

291
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,800
You then compare that to the imputed average blood glucose from a hemoglobin A1C. And if 25% of our

292
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,560
patients are concordant, that's pretty good. 75% are discordant and it could be in either direction.

293
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,680
That's the point. In other words, for a subset of patients, the hemoglobin A1C that you measure in

294
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,960
their blood, which imputes an average blood glucose is underestimating their average. And in a subset,

295
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,160
it's the opposite. This has led me to first and foremost be quite suspect of hemoglobin A1C. I

296
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,240
first noticed this in myself, by the way, I'm incredibly discordant. I suspect it's because

297
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,160
of my beta thalassemia minor, which grossly overstates my hemoglobin A1C. But again,

298
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,200
seeing as many cases in the opposite direction, you realize this test is helpful when comparing

299
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,840
the difference between someone who's at 5.1 versus 8.1. It offers no fidelity between five and six,

300
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,520
in my opinion. It's such an important point you brought up because I have patients that come in

301
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,240
and we've made incredible transformations on every metric, but they literally look at their blood

302
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,480
reports. These are very motivated South Asians who are very focused on numbers and grades. And

303
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,600
they're like, I'm still not getting that A1C down. I'm not getting that fasting glucose down to 99.

304
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,200
And they obsess over that, Peter. They're like, do I need to go more low carb? Do I need to work

305
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,600
out harder? And it's just a matter of listen, metabolically, by my definition, you're healthy,

306
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,360
let's not obsess over this number and focus on bigger things. So interestingly, I haven't really

307
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
incorporated CGM into my practice as something I need to do. I've definitely prescribed it for

308
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,440
some patients. And I know you are nice enough to actually connect me and get me motivated to get

309
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,120
one. And I haven't done that yet. So I think that'll be I'm sticking to numb fingers right now with

310
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,480
lots of finger sticks about today. So I've got to get with the times. I think you should. And I

311
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,720
think you'll be really impressed with I think, and again, maybe every patient population is a

312
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,200
little bit different. Maybe my patients are a bit more motivated. But who knows? That's not necessarily

313
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,640
the case. I think patients find it valuable on two fronts. The first is the insights are really

314
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,960
impressive. You just can't believe how much certain things can affect your glucose levels,

315
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,000
even the most benign thing, like a handful of raisins or a particularly large Fuji apple or

316
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,760
something like that. And then conversely, how eating the exact same amount of glucose with

317
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,480
something else can delay that transit and slow it down. And then of course, how what you eat in

318
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,880
proximity to exercise versus time of day versus how well you slept the night before. So there's

319
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,080
like the entire insight sphere. And what I usually tell patients is at the outset, the first three to

320
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:05,560
six months of wearing CGM is 80 percent new insights and 20 percent behavioral modification,

321
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,520
which is the gamification that comes from once you know what to do, actually doing it because you

322
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,680
like the numbers. But then you sort of get past that point and you learn most of it and you're

323
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,840
not getting surprised all that much. And then the benefit actually becomes the behavioral one. I've

324
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,880
been wearing one of these things now for probably three and a half or four years. So for me,

325
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm not gaining new insights daily. Maybe every week I get a new little insight.

326
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,960
So maybe it's 10 percent insight related. But the behavioral piece, it's basically a walking

327
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,200
Hawthorne effect. I was going to ask you about are you wearing it now more for behavior? I think

328
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,360
you've gotten all the insights, but this really prevents you from digging that bag of Cheetos or

329
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,920
whatever. That's exactly right. We have pretty clear metrics with where we want to be both in

330
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,080
terms of average glucose, in terms of standard deviation of glucose, which we use as kind of a

331
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,920
proxy for insulin. And then in terms of the number of times you have excursions over 140, that becomes

332
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,720
kind of another metric you want to avoid. And so it absolutely curbs my behavior when I am wearing

333
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,720
it, which is most of the time, probably 300 to 330 days out of a year I'm wearing it definitely dials

334
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,600
my behavior in. Absolutely. So now going back to this point, you've got these different phenotypes

335
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,680
of diabetes. And I think that the whole diagnosis of just relying on an A1C being above 6.5 is not

336
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,600
very helpful because one, I don't think I trust that number enough to hang my hat on it. And secondly,

337
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,000
why is it that somebody who's got maybe an average blood glucose of 120, which wouldn't quite be at

338
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,400
that threshold at a fasting level, but has these postprandial glucoses of 200, why would we not

339
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,360
consider that person to be at risk? And yet we don't treat that person in the same way. So

340
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,840
my view is basically to tell patients, I'm not remotely interested in any of these labels.

341
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,160
They don't mean anything. I don't actually look at hemoglobin A1C except out of the intellectual

342
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,800
exercise of contrasting it with this CGM. But instead it's that level of insulin, fasting,

343
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,400
postprandial, plus glucose, postprandial with all of the kinetics that we can track,

344
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,600
and then layer it into this other stuff, which is what's the inflammatory cascade look like? Because

345
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,600
this is sort of what I was going to get at is you have these phenotypes, I think, where you've got

346
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,080
that person who's overweight, who metabolically actually looks pretty reasonable and they're

347
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,160
doing a lot of the stuff correctly, but there's probably something going on at the cortisol level.

348
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,800
And this is another thing we see with the CGM is these very, very high nighttime glucose levels

349
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,280
in people who are otherwise eating pretty well. So I guess it's hard to track that without CGM

350
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,520
because the best, the only glimpse you get is the morning glucose level, which as you know,

351
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,040
can be easily 110 in someone who's metabolically quite healthy by other parameters. Do you see

352
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,240
cortisol as being a bigger driver of that inflammation? What else do you see?

353
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,960
So I'm going to throw some theories at you. And I want to run this by you as well too,

354
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,600
because even without CGM, I noticed this pattern myself very early on. And I started

355
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,720
noticing in my patients and I started really focusing on them, calming down their nighttime

356
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,800
rituals, getting off the devices, doing some meditative practices in the evenings,

357
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,120
and checking their fasting blood sugars the next day. And I clearly saw improved fasting blood

358
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,960
sugars. And it makes so much sense, Peter, when you think about the fact that the liver is really

359
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,960
in charge of what that morning blood sugar is going to be, and the liver, the cortisol is such

360
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,360
a huge input to that. And when you think about the process intellectually, if these are individuals

361
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,480
who are already insulin resistant, presumably their adipose tissues have a lot of free fatty

362
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,800
acid release and lipolysis. So you've already got free fatty acids going to the liver to fuel

363
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,680
gluconeogenesis. Now, if you add cortisol on top of that, cortisol has the exact same effect on

364
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,280
adipose tissue, right? So you've got two sort of lipolytic inputs, a higher pool of free fatty acids

365
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,840
going to the liver. So that liver is primed to produce sugar. So to me, physiologically makes

366
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
perfect sense. It's very tough to make that case to patients because they want it to be their diet

367
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,000
and their exercise. They're like, just tell me how many more carbs I can cut out of my dinner,

368
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,320
or do I need to do this workout? And I'm like, this is an emotional metabolic issue. So I've seen

369
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,080
that for sure. And when we actually do influence those types of things and do those nighttime

370
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,040
behaviors, the numbers get better. In addition to that, what I've also noticed is sometimes when

371
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,320
patients are too low carb with their diets, sometimes that will trigger a reflex hyperglycemia.

372
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,680
And the way they're trying to game that is sometimes they'll eat some starches at nighttime.

373
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,200
And I was going to ask you, even though that's making their numbers better in the morning,

374
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,160
it's sort of interrupting their fast. So I'm thinking, are we just gaming the numbers to

375
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,680
make your report card better? Are we physiologically really doing some good in the body? And that's

376
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,760
where I get a little bit hesitant about just focusing on single digit numbers like fasting

377
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,760
blood glucose. Yeah, it's funny you say that. I definitely have a subset of patients who are

378
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,160
actually coming to my mind just as we have this discussion who are really fixated on that morning

379
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,280
glucose level. I think it's tough. I'm very curious as to what's going on. I have reached

380
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,760
out to a number of people who study this and I haven't really got a satisfactory answer yet,

381
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,720
but there's something I can't figure out in the liver and you alluded to it.

382
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,600
So taking a step back just for the listener, a blood glucose of a hundred milligrams per

383
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,320
deciliter means you have about five grams of glucose in your bloodstream. That means if you

384
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,240
have a blood volume of five liters, which average size person has at a hundred milligrams per

385
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,160
deciliter is five grams of glucose. That's one teaspoon of glucose. Now that's not a lot. That's

386
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:18,200
a few minutes worth of metabolic fuel, especially given that the brain is going to consume 25% of

387
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,560
your total energy all in the form of glucose. In other words, the brain is taking two to three

388
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,400
grams out of that five within minutes. So if you can do a thought experiment and you clamp the

389
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,240
portal vein, you prevent the liver from putting any glucose into circulation, an organism is going

390
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,920
to be dead in minutes. It is simply going to die of hypoglycemia. So that's point one. Point two is

391
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,120
how well this machine is regulated. The difference between you sitting here now with a glucose of

392
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,760
100 milligrams per deciliter, which we would consider perfectly normal, and you sitting here

393
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,640
with a blood glucose level of 200 milligrams per deciliter first thing in the morning,

394
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,280
which is Frank type two diabetes, do not pass go, do not collect $200 diabetes. That's a difference

395
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:11,080
of one additional teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream or another five minutes of metabolic

396
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,960
substrate. And again, first thing in the morning, that's being regulated by the liver. Why is it

397
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,120
then that in the person with type two diabetes, that liver can't just back off a little bit on

398
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,120
its hepatic glucose output to bring that person from 200 down to 100. And if you ask that question

399
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,560
at an even more subtle level outside of diabetes, why is it that your patient or my patient or me

400
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:39,880
or you wake up sometimes with a blood glucose of 120 versus 90, which is, I mean, we're talking now

401
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,920
about milligrams of glucose in terms of difference. So how much of this is being regulated at the

402
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,240
liver? How much of this is being regulated at the pancreas? How much of this is being regulated at

403
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,280
the muscles? And I still can't really wrap my head around why this is happening. And I certainly

404
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,840
suspect that cortisol is playing an important role. I think cortisol is a vastly underappreciated

405
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,600
regulator of fat flux through the fat cell. Insulin gets a lot of attention because it's

406
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,880
perhaps the most potent both on the side of lipolysis and reesterification. And we also can't

407
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,120
measure things like hormone sensitive lipase easily. So we have to sort of not think about

408
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,440
that much. But in cortisol, because it's such a pain to measure and we can't measure free cortisol

409
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,320
in the blood, we just sort of loosely think about it. But I can't help but wonder if that's playing

410
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,160
a role. Now, Jason Fung, who I spoke with about this, he has a very interesting model of insulin

411
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
resistance, which is that it's not actually resistance. It's just basically the storage

412
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,800
tank is full. So the elevated level of glucose is because the glycogen stores are basically tapped

413
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:49,560
out. And the elevated level of insulin is not because the insulin receptors and or the

414
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,920
intracellular mechanistic transducers are themselves quote unquote resistant. It's just

415
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,040
trying to push harder and harder to get the glucose in. That model, by the way, makes a lot

416
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,440
of sense through the lens of the fact that even the most quote unquote insulin resistant person

417
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,800
has no difficulty putting more fat into a fat cell, which is also signaled by insulin. So what

418
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:17,000
I like about Jason's model is it gets rid of the discordance between how can you have an insulin

419
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,960
resistant muscle and an insulin sensitive fat cell mechanistically, to which I've never had

420
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,200
a compelling response. Have you thought through that particular issue? It's interesting because

421
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,040
that's exactly the model I use when I do education for patients. It's very easy to just tell them

422
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,760
about parking space muscles got a fixed amount. And I think it makes a lot of sense in that sense.

423
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,840
I think one of the issues is when you look at these patients early on. So if you look at

424
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,040
the studies of normal glucose tolerance offspring of diabetic parents, so these are normal glucose

425
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,440
tolerance individuals that are relatively lean. They don't have inflammatory markers. So they

426
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,080
haven't really shown many manifestations. But the earliest changes that you basically see

427
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,320
is that they already have elevated levels of free fatty acid circulating. So already you can see

428
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,120
that in these populations, whether they're South Asians or Hispanics, their visceral fat is already

429
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,360
outputting a little bit of extra free fatty acid. And we know that free fatty acid is a chemical

430
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,920
signal for interrupting insulin resistance sort of signaling. So at that point, I'm thinking that,

431
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,280
yes, it probably is a capacity issue. But I think that early signal is limiting the ability of the

432
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,680
muscle to really store that glycogen because it's already inhibiting glycogen synthesis, basically at

433
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,560
that level already. So I think in people that don't have insulin resistance, absolutely that parking

434
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,720
capacity makes sense. I think with people that have insulin resistance, it makes sense too. But we

435
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,280
also have to acknowledge that people that have had insulin resistance from in utero is what we're

436
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,080
seeing in these populations. They already have a very limited capacity. And it's not necessarily

437
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,560
physical. They just have less because of the free fatty acid that's inhibiting the insulin signaling,

438
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,200
if that makes sense. Yeah, I mean, I guess the question is, which comes first is sort of the

439
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,080
thing I'm struggling with here. And I think of it even more upstream, which is frankly, just looking

440
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:59,640
at the liver, I don't think it's like a particularly profound statement to say that the liver is the

441
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,160
leading edge of the airfoil. The liver is seeing everything at a speed and at a level that

442
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,840
transcends everything. It is the epicenter of our metabolism, at least that's my view. And

443
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,080
when I see things like fat flux in the liver leading in the direction of accumulation, that has

444
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,880
to be a bad sign. But of course, then I can poke holes in my own theory by saying, look at all the

445
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,240
people who develop all of the other negative symptoms and signs, but by ultrasound at least,

446
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,160
or even by MRI, they don't have fat in their liver and they usually have normal triglycerides.

447
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,640
And yet they have these other issues that you're alluding to. This is why I appreciate you saying

448
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,480
that you truly don't understand insulin resistance. Because I think when people say they do understand

449
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,960
it, literally, I've written diagrams of every possible thing in your heads and circles, you

450
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,880
step back thinking, I really don't get this at all. But it's true. And there may not be one cycle

451
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,040
because I think I was trying to find one process flow that would explain all these cases. There

452
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,520
could be multiple, I mean, we can see arrows and diagrams going in multiple directions. And I

453
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,800
realized at a certain point that I need to understand this process, but I'm probably not

454
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,160
going to figure out exactly for each individual patient, I've sort of got to go for the low

455
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,480
hanging fruit and see what's going to lead to the most meaningful lifestyle changes for them.

456
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,320
That's a good point to make. Because I think if you're listening to this, you're thinking, well,

457
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,840
if Peter and Ron are sitting here, basically acknowledging they don't know what insulin

458
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,560
resistance is, does it matter? And more importantly, what does it mean to me? And so,

459
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,080
yeah, I emphatically say, I don't know what insulin resistance means anymore.

460
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,400
I have theories. The theories are plausible if you permit me to wave my hands a little bit and

461
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,280
acknowledge that there are going to be different categories of insulin resistance that will apply

462
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,640
to different patients. But I can't give you mechanistic explanations as to why. But it's why

463
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,520
I do tend to focus on hyperinsulinemia. Because I really, when I talk to patients about the endocrine

464
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,160
system, I usually walk them through four of them. I say broadly speaking, let's look at this through

465
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,640
the level of your thyroid system. And so, again, we talk about what's happening between the

466
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,480
hypothalamus, the pituitary, the thyroid, and the periphery. Let's call that one system. And then I

467
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,520
say, let's now have the same discussion about the adrenal system. Again, same sort of connection.

468
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,600
And then let's have a similar discussion about your sex hormones. And then the fourth system I

469
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,880
talk about is this system of fuel partitioning, which of course has to do with how does the energy

470
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,920
you consume get stored and how do you access energy? And usually they get the first three,

471
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,200
but then it's that fourth one that's sort of like, what do you mean by fuel partitioning? And I say,

472
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,200
well, first of all, blood can only give us part of the answers here. I mean, you have to do some

473
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,520
other metabolic testing to get the others. But I said, we don't have a hard time talking about

474
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,160
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. So we can simplify this fuel partitioning problem by at

475
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,880
least looking at one element of it, which is hyperinsulinemia. And in some ways, that's why

476
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I still really favor the oral glucose tolerance test. Again, whether we should be using glucola

477
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,320
or not, the only advantage of glucola is at least we have a standardized way for me and you

478
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,200
and Joseph Kraft and everybody to compare our numbers. But you could make a case that it's sort

479
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,880
of not particularly reflective of the physiologic glucose disposal. And maybe instead we should

480
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,760
have the pizza test or give people carbs in a way that they normally consume them. I actually have

481
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,520
done this a few times. I had a patient who, I mean, she made the point, which is this test doesn't

482
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,200
replicate anything I do. And I said, yeah, you're right. I know. And I explained to her all the

483
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,120
stuff. And I said, well, what does a real cheat look like for you? What is blowing it up mean? And

484
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,160
she's like, it's like two margaritas and five cookies. And I was like, okay, well, that's your

485
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,640
next glucose tolerance test. Right. Now, of course, the problem is we still end up doing that test in

486
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,880
the morning, but even that's not the right thing to do. If you really want to do this test correctly,

487
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,480
you would do the two margaritas and the five cookies in the afternoon or whenever you're

488
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,120
going to do it. And in many ways, that's what the CGM has kind of allowed us to do. The CGM without

489
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,600
the insulin is at least allowing us to see the glycemic response to the real world challenge

490
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,360
of this. And while I still rely on the OGTT constantly, my hope is that eventually we're

491
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,160
going to be able to do more point of care insulin testing and there is actually work in that space

492
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,560
being done. And maybe we're done with this sort of glucose type test. Yeah. To bring it back to

493
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,600
your point, I thought I kind of understood insulin resistance seven or eight years ago,

494
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,520
and I'm pretty sure I don't anymore. But I'm finding ways to reframe insulin resistance

495
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,680
because I think even in the early days since I developed it, I had sort of this toxic relationship

496
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,480
with glucose triglycerides. And as I look at more of the evolutionary literature, there's a lot of

497
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,440
theories, including thrifty gene, the Barker hypothesis, and just to summarize for the listeners.

498
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,080
So when we talk about the thrifty gene, this was James Neil back in the 1960s who came up with a

499
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,840
concept that insulin resistance is basically a result of us, our primitive ancestors living in

500
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,400
feast famine type cycles. And during feast periods, what they would do is they'd store extra

501
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,040
calories, this really abdominally, and store calories as triglycerides so they can survive

502
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,280
during times of famine. And it was a very popular theory back then, but then there was never a puta

503
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,520
gene found for that. And then really, when you talk to experts, they say we never really had,

504
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,600
if you look at sort of evolution, there were not large periods of famine that really could explain

505
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,320
that sort of a genetic manifestation. So that basically evolved into this concept of a thrifty

506
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,160
phenotype or the Barker hypothesis. And this is really based not really on genes, but the fact that

507
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,040
the intrauterine environment itself is what can trigger insulin resistance and heart disease. And

508
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,720
what David Barker found, and this was in the 1912, I think, and what he found was he looked at 100,000

509
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,840
people in the UK, and he looked at records that showed that birth weight was inversely proportional

510
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,920
to mortality from heart disease. And literally, when they've reproduced this, they found this in

511
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,480
every continent. So low birth weight equals higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and early

512
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,040
cardiovascular mortality. And they found this in every continent except Africa. And when you look

513
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,080
at that, and then you look at the work of Dr. C.S. Yajnik, and he's done incredible studies in low

514
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,800
birth weight babies in India, particularly Pune. And he's found that already at a very early stage,

515
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,040
when the babies were born, they're already showing fetal hyperinsulinemia, their body

516
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,080
habitus is already small, tiny, fetal, pot belly, visceral fat, and very thin extremities.

517
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,680
When you check their skin fold, you basically see that they already have limited subcutaneous

518
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,080
fat when you compare them to Caucasians. And so this whole concept has come up about insulin

519
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,160
resistance is this really a response to stress in utero, basically. And then another theory that he

520
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,960
came up with is a soldier to diplomat hypothesis, which I found very interesting, where initially,

521
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,240
we might look at this problem as being something that allowed us to preserve more glucose for brain

522
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,560
function. So insulin resistance really is an evolutionary adaptation that allows more glucose

523
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,480
to be available. So our brain can use it to really thrive and survive. We always talk about

524
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,120
our primitive ancestors in terms of musculature, but you need to have adequate amounts of glucose

525
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,600
reserve. So you can go up the social hierarchy and you can lead a tribe. And I spoke to Jerry

526
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,080
Reven about this early on. So Jerry Reven, he coined the term metabolic syndrome, the late Jerry

527
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,480
Reven. And we talked about the fact that what do you think is a role of insulin resistance? And he

528
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,520
agreed that there's probably some mechanism where it does help certain populations preserve glucose

529
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,000
for brain function. And when you look at the South Asian population, interestingly, they are

530
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,120
the most highly insulin resistant country on the planet right now. And interestingly, if you look

531
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,200
at sort of the metabolic shifts that are happening in terms of glucose and lipids, a lot of these are

532
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,640
basically trophic to the brain. So Dr. Yajnik, he saw that basically this hyperinsulinemia,

533
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,400
we know that insulin and you've mentioned this before with IGF above the neck, it does have

534
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,840
trophic impact. So if you're in your door and you've got elevated glucose and elevated insulin,

535
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,400
presumably it can have some impact on increasing IQ and intelligence in that period. And obviously,

536
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,480
if it's an overcorrection of the system, if you're flooding that child with lots of sugar and carbs,

537
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,240
that could go the other way. But it looks like there might be some adaptive qualities to insulin

538
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,120
resistance that sort of help with brain function and cognitive abilities. And again, I'm more guilty

539
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,480
of this than the next person, but we keep doing this, right? Which is we use the term insulin

540
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,880
resistance right after we acknowledge we don't even know what it means. And so what you're really

541
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,280
describing is the hyperinsulinemia with compensatory high glucose. So actually, Jake Kushner just sent

542
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,760
me a paper last week that I don't want to say too much about it because I'm still going back

543
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,840
and forth with him on sort of the interpretation, but the paper is trying to look at mechanisms for

544
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,600
why refeeding after carbohydrate restriction produces elevated glucose. And unfortunately,

545
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,000
I don't want to sort of criticize the paper too much before having gotten fully through it, but

546
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,160
my first reading of the paper is, God, they seem underfunded. They didn't measure, they didn't

547
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,760
collect urinary C-peptide. There are a lot of things they didn't do because at the first order,

548
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,160
there's a question, which is, let's just pretend, and the paper looks at carbohydrate restriction,

549
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,840
but I'm actually more interested in fasting. So let's just take either one of those cases. So

550
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,680
either I carbohydrate restrict you or I fast you, and then I refeed you. Why do you have this

551
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,720
disproportionate glucose response initially? Is it because of the muscle being resistant to the

552
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,000
effect of insulin or is it because the pancreatic response is especially slow or is it something

553
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,400
else? Is it a combination of these things? These are very testable hypotheses and certainly the

554
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,400
first thing I'd want to know, and again, I don't think they did it in this paper, which is sort of

555
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,440
what I sent back to Jake the other day, which is you'd at least want to rule out that it's not

556
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,200
a blunted or delayed insulin response. Insular pancreases, you could anthropomorphize this any

557
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,920
way you want. So do you have a point of view on that issue of why is it that someone who's,

558
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,040
let's just say for the purpose of this discussion, carbohydrate restricted,

559
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,360
or in the case of our ancestors who were without glucose or without meals for days at a time,

560
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,320
upon reintroducing it, look like they're hyperglycemic? I mean, they are hyperglycemic.

561
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,960
Right. I mean, this is all theoretical. For me, if you look at ancestral and evolutionary sort

562
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,600
of survival, I think if you've gone through a famine period, when you're refed, the brain is

563
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,520
still the number one organ that you want to fuel. And we know after feedings and carbohydrate

564
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,640
feedings that the skeletal muscle is responsible for 80 to 90% of glucose disposal. So to me,

565
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,400
theoretically seems to make sense that probably the resistance is happening at the skeletal

566
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,400
muscle level. And that's really preserving probably an over-corrected amount of glucose

567
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,960
for brain function. So you would predict based on this study that if they'd measure it, insulin

568
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,960
would be normal. The insulin secretion would be normal. I think relatively yes. And again,

569
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,120
obviously you can have mixed pictures. If this is advanced enough, you might see that. But in a pure

570
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,360
sense, I would say you probably would see more of that with relatively preserved insulin. We might

571
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,120
probably have to do a clamp study to really make that come true. So yeah, I'm working with a guy

572
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,720
who's got a device that can actually measure insulin and see peptide at point of care. So

573
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,160
one of the things I'd like to do on my next fast is when I break a really long fast, use a standardized

574
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,320
meal of glucose to refeed and then see what the glucose and insulin responses to that. And after

575
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,520
say seven days of zero input and contrast that with the same meal given in the context of being

576
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,920
normal fed. Yeah, that would be interesting. Yeah. So hopefully I'll get to that. I might even

577
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,120
get to that before this podcast comes out. So if it's possible about the time this comes out,

578
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,960
I will have already done that and maybe even talked about it. Another point too, I'd have to

579
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,720
look back to the study, but when you flood the system with insulin, even in normal glucose

580
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,000
tolerance individuals, if you flood them for 24 or 48 hours, they have a significant diminution of

581
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,560
their beta cell function. I mean, it already sort of has a depressant effect on that. And I think

582
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,480
when you study patients that have even early stage insulin resistance, they've got somewhat

583
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,560
fatigue beta cell function already. And coming back to those fetal studies, they already found

584
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,120
that even with fetal hyperinsulinemia, the beta cells were just now as developed. They're already

585
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,600
showing some signs of early wear and tear just from in utero hyperinsulinemia. So I think a lot

586
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,280
of these individuals already have sort of a second rate pancreas and that on top of that, if you're

587
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,800
flooding with hyperinsulinemia, yes, it's going to cause some skeletal muscle resistance, but

588
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,520
there's probably some combination of some beta cell dysfunction along with that. Was there not

589
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,040
a study and I don't even want to put out a year because I'm sure I'm wrong. I think it was like

590
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:58,760
2013 that actually showed genetically that both East and South Asians had lower beta cell density

591
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,040
genetically and that that feeds into what you just said as another part of the predisposition to

592
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,120
almost bypassing the obesity phenotype. So you go from, because again, you could think of this as

593
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:19,320
the standard Caucasian path is normal to hyperinsulinemia, to obese, to diabetic. And

594
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:24,040
where these Asian populations, they just seem to skip the obesity phenotype more often than not,

595
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,520
and they end up going metabolic dysregulated, which is could be partially explained by bypassing

596
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,960
hyperinsulinemia if you have less beta cell either density or functionality in some way.

597
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,320
No, I think that makes a lot of sense.

598
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,120
And am I right? Am I memory correct that there were studies demonstrating this?

599
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,800
There was and I remember seeing the data in the South Asians. It might have been in one study

600
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,000
where they combined both populations. So I'd have to look back at that, but definitely I've seen

601
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,080
other studies in South Asians about beta cell dysfunction that happens earlier. And there's a

602
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,440
genetic link with that as well.

603
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,120
And kind of bringing it right back to where you talked at the outset, the other study that I think

604
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,600
is interesting is when you looked at the liposuction study, this was in the New England Journal of

605
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:06,840
Medicine. I want to say it was 04 ish. I think Sam Klein was one of the authors. You took metabolically

606
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,080
dysregulated people, you did liposuction, and I think they averaged about 30 pounds of fat removal

607
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,160
from both the superficial and deep subcutaneous space, which is all that you can access through

608
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:23,480
liposuction. And there is no metabolic improvement in the patient, which again, makes a very compelling

609
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:31,080
case that it's not fat per se. It is the proxy even for metabolic dysfunction. In general, it's

610
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,360
this visceral pool of fat.

611
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,960
Exactly. If you think of that subcutaneous, like we talked about as being your safety belt,

612
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,240
you're kind of removing part of that safety belt. So I would expect that that's not going to have any

613
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,960
impact because the visceral is where all the action is happening.

614
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,520
And I don't know, I doubt this is ever going to be done in humans, but in animals, has anybody

615
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:52,520
done the liposuction of visceral fat and seen if that improves metabolism or is it again, the

616
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,720
visceral fat is just a proxy for something even more sinister metabolically and molecularly?

617
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,720
I haven't seen that study yet. This is a little bit related, but there's a lot of interesting

618
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,440
research on brown adipose tissue. And I'm certain starting to really focus on this because coming

619
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,680
back to evolution, if you look at the patterns of migration, so if we look at our out of Africa

620
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,480
migration from 70,000 years ago, and when populations dispersed to different parts of

621
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,560
the world, the ones that dispersed further north into colder climactic regions, when you look at

622
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,640
their brown adipose tissue and the genes that determine that, they've got significantly more

623
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,600
brown adipose tissue. And they've done studies to compare brown adipose tissue in South Asians

624
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,600
versus Europeans. And we've got significantly less brown adipose tissue. And just to sort of

625
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,320
back up for folks that don't know what brown adipose tissue is, brown adipose tissue is actually

626
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,720
metabolically active. It's brown because of increasing density of mitochondria. Brown

627
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,760
adipose tissue in newborns generates more heat to keep the newborn's body warm. So our populations

628
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,720
and ancestors that migrated to colder climates, they actually have more brown adipose tissue.

629
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,200
Their resting metabolism is higher, they can generate more heat. And that thermogenic

630
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,280
metabolism can actually account for at rest between 15 to 18% of calories burned throughout the day.

631
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,520
It's pretty market. And when you look at that, and you think about migration patterns and

632
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,520
insulin resistance, the interesting thing is if you look at native population, you look at the

633
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,920
Inuit and Eskimos in the colder regions, they've obviously got very low insulin resistance. But

634
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,240
then look at the PMI Indians and others that migrated to southern sort of areas of the world,

635
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,640
they have much higher risk of insulin resistance. Even with India, when you look at the country

636
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,560
itself, in the northern parts that are near the Himalayas, you have some of the lowest incidents

637
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,400
of insulin resistance. So there's a place called Manipur, which is near the Himalayas. And they

638
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,200
have single digits, basically insulin resistance and diabetes. The highest rates of diabetes in

639
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,400
India are further south near the equator. So Kerala has by far the highest, I mean, the prevalence

640
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,440
here is up to 20%. So it's all over the world, you see this pattern and the brown adipose tissue is

641
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,760
turning out to be really interesting because number one, it's not only more metabolically active,

642
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,080
but it actually is a glucose disposal organ, it can actually remove glucose from the system.

643
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,720
And they did a study coming back to this where they took rats, and they took brown adipose tissue out

644
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,800
of a rat, and they basically put it in another rat. And they showed insulin resistance was

645
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,560
completely reversed basically just by brown adipose tissue transplantation.

646
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,200
And when you look at those two regions of India, what are their phenotypic differences in body

647
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,360
morphism composition? So the phenotypic differences typically in South Indians,

648
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,840
they're shorter in vertical height, they tend to have a little bit more visceral adiposity,

649
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,680
so a little bit more larger pot bellies in the north, as you move further up north,

650
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,760
probably a little bit more lean body mass, basically a little bit taller. The skin type

651
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,160
as well too in the south darker skin, we see a lot more significant vitamin D deficiency. And

652
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,760
when I see these individuals, they have a vitamin D level of maybe three or four basically,

653
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,880
so way down single digits. And up north, I don't tend to see that as much either. So there's

654
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,440
interesting variations between those two. And then coming back to this brain hypothesis,

655
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,840
interestingly, even though they're more insulin resistant in South India, anecdotally, they also

656
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:58,200
have the most competent scientists and mathematicians in the south. So a lot of the brain influx into

657
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,360
Silicon Valley is coming from South Indian cities. So I've had this discussion with, I had this with

658
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,200
Jerry before and I asked him that, do you think there might be something about the fact that the

659
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,360
most insulin resistant part of India, somehow there's some sort of cognitive benefit they get

660
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,480
from that insulin resistance? And he thought it was an interesting theory, we'll have to see.

661
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,480
But are there activity differences between them? I mean, you'd get the sense that the folks in the

662
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,000
northern part of Italy near the Himalayas are also more active. Like there seems like there would be

663
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,720
so many confounders, it would be very difficult. Very tough. Yeah, absolutely. But even if you look

664
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,840
at the populations in Kerala and Southern India, where it's more of a native sort of a village

665
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,960
climate. And the other thing that they have is they have increased fish intake. So they eat a lot

666
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,000
of seafood. But even in studies done in more of the rural populations where they are physically

667
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,920
active, they still see very high levels of insulin resistance. But you're absolutely right. There can

668
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,000
be multiple confounders to sort of account for that. But in general, if you look at sort of the

669
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,320
globe and you look at insulin resistance patterns, climate has a lot to do with it. And it might lead

670
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,440
to a phenotype of basically who can manage baseline adipose metabolism better in terms of generating

671
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,760
heat. Now you brought up vitamin D. So let's go down into that rabbit hole for a moment. There's

672
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,400
another topic my point of view has really started to change on. So I've never seen a vitamin D level

673
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,520
of three or four. That's pretty impressive. What risk is that person at? And how are they living

674
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,520
such that that's their I don't mean why are they alive? I mean, what is their lifestyle that is

675
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,920
producing a vitamin D level that low? A lot of it's obviously it comes down to their skin pigment.

676
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,000
So they're clearly not absorbing as much. And then lifestyle wise, most of them are spending most of

677
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,760
their time indoors. They work at high tech companies in their cars all day. So you're not

678
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,720
seeing this from people who are actually back in India per se necessarily working outside or

679
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,880
not stuck in front of a computer all day. Even the ones that are spending time outside,

680
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,480
they're fully clothed. So it's kind of a taboo to be in a tank top and work out and things like that

681
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,800
in that population. So even my patients that are a little bit more physically active and outdoors,

682
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,840
they're runners and they spend a lot of time outdoors. They still have pretty relatively

683
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,560
compromised vitamin D levels. And some of that is vitamin D resistance. Some of it is just a fact

684
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,880
that they're not absorbing enough. And in the early days, definitely I would replace anybody with

685
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,560
that sort of level you have to replace. But I wouldn't say that more is necessarily better.

686
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,760
I don't know if South Asians are adapted to have vitamin D levels of 60 or 80 plus. It makes sense

687
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,720
to get them between 30 to 40. Anecdotally what I have seen, and this is completely anecdotally,

688
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,880
is in some of those patients, I definitely see that C-Ractive proteins do improve because vitamin

689
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,600
D does have some anti-inflammatory effect. I was hoping based on some of the studies that I came

690
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,600
across, and I'd love your input on this, that it would help a little bit with glucose disposal

691
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,520
because vitamin D does have some ergogenic benefits at the muscular level. I haven't seen

692
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,920
that pan out in my patients. The one thing I have seen as a pattern is it definitely has helped with

693
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,480
hypertension. I've definitely seen when I get vitamin D levels up in my resistant hypertensives,

694
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,000
we often see their blood pressure controls much better. But I'd love your feedback on if you've

695
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
seen any patterns when you've replenished. Again, you have had single digit ones, but I'm sure you

696
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,400
see plenty of individuals with low vitamin D. I've never seen anybody below 10. I know I'm talking

697
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,240
to people like you that they're walking around out there, but if I see somebody in the 10 to 20 range,

698
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,440
that would typically be low. Again, I used to think that 40 to 60 was where people needed to be,

699
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,400
and I would replace people to get there. I'd no longer do that. I just want people above 30

700
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,880
without supplementation is my point of view now. I'm generally taking vitamin D away from people.

701
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,360
The problem is there's a really good sleep supplement out there that contains vitamin D,

702
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:20,040
and I would love it if it contained none or much less because it's confounding this. I'm

703
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,160
seeing people show up with vitamin D levels of 80 and 90, which just doesn't make sense to me that

704
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,600
that's a place where we want to be. Especially if you're dealing with a patient. Again, I'd love

705
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,480
your input on just the higher rate of coronary calcification that we see in this population too.

706
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,240
So it does make me nervous to just drive their vitamin D higher the better. So I'm pretty

707
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,480
conservative with that number. I don't take vitamin D anymore, and I think for years I took it. I

708
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:47,800
don't supplement anymore. My natural place to be is probably in the 30s to 40s just based on

709
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,400
any time I can be out in the backyard shooting. If I take my shirt off, I figure I'm getting my

710
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,560
vitamin D that way. But again, I know that's not practical for everybody. Not everybody lives in a

711
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,320
Southern California climate. Not everybody has the pigment that I do, which basically means I

712
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,360
can't get a sunburn if I try. I'm unburnable. Exactly. So I have that luxury that I don't think

713
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,520
everybody does. So no, I'm still really trying to wrap my head around this. But I would say the

714
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,160
placebo effect is huge. When somebody has a vitamin D level of three and all of a sudden is 30,

715
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,400
they're like, man, I have so much more energy. I feel great, but that's more anecdotal,

716
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,880
but I don't know if physiologically they're really getting some benefit.

717
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,280
Yeah. I haven't seen the blood pressure issue where our little sort of great trick on blood

718
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,520
pressure is lowering uric acid. That's huge. I mean, in fact, I take such an extreme view on

719
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,960
this that I don't even think one should use antihypertensive medication until uric acid is below

720
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,360
five. So if you've got a patient walking around the uric acid of seven who's got hypertension,

721
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,640
they've got to be on allopurinol first, metabolically fixed, which by the way, may or may not correct

722
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,280
their uric acid, doesn't necessarily do so, especially if they use nutritional ketosis and

723
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,320
fasting, which you'll often see raise the uric acid level. But the effect of uric acid on blood

724
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,680
pressure is pretty profound. And do you think that's more of a, when you're correcting the

725
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,280
uric acid, you're addressing the underlying hyperinsulinemia or is there something independent

726
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,400
about uric acid? No, I think there's something quite independent about it because you'll even

727
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,040
see this with just the use of allopurinol. Yeah. So yeah, if you were looking at the correction

728
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,600
of uric acid with the metabolic correction, I would say it's impossible to know, but just

729
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,760
with independent reduction. Yeah. And Rick Johnson actually has a paper that's in the

730
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,760
New England Journal of Medicine that goes through this case. Rick's done some really interesting

731
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,200
work. You talked about the out of Africa migration. Rick's looked at the uric case

732
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,880
mutation that occurred after we, so one civilization left Africa to go to Europe.

733
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:38,360
It turned out that this mutation of uric case allowed us to store much more energy in the form

734
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,720
of fat from fructose. And one of the byproducts of that is generating uric acid. But this became

735
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:49,960
really a beneficial mutation to acquire because fruit is at its ripest in the fall. So it's going

736
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,240
to be sweetest. So you could actually really eat a ton of fruit and actually store it as energy in

737
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,080
the form of fat. And you would generate uric acid along the way. And it seems that only the subset

738
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:06,600
of our ancestors are the primates that developed that mutation, were able to survive these European

739
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,240
winters and then come back to Africa. And so he argues, I think quite convincingly, although I

740
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,320
haven't had him on the podcast yet to go into this in gory detail, but talk with him about this a ton

741
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,080
and read his papers, that it was this ability to actually turn fructose through de novo lipogenesis

742
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,960
into fat as a byproduct to generate uric acid. That's actually what allowed us to come back to

743
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,200
Africa to have survived a European winter and then to basically proliferate. So this ability to

744
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,320
generate uric acid is not unique to all species. It's something quite unique to those that came

745
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,440
from the lineage of having to survive basically a cold winter without much food. Hey, Peter,

746
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,920
real quick before I begin, speaking of energy output, the other thing that you see in insulin

747
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,000
resistant individuals, especially South Asians is when you compare them, when you actually put them

748
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,080
through exercise testing, when you take age matched BMI matched, and you check their submaximal VO2

749
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,960
maxes. Typically, in all these studies you look at their VO2 max is correlated with their level

750
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,000
of insulin resistance, and they have substantially less VO2 max output under submaximal exercise.

751
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,200
One of the things that's really interesting is with normal glucose tolerance offspring studies.

752
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:17,080
You're meaning the higher the degree of hyperinsulinemia, the lower their maximal VO2.

753
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Yes, exactly. It's hard to tell what the link is, which way it goes.

754
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,240
Wouldn't that association be true across the board? Are you saying that it's disproportionately the

755
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,800
case? I'm sorry. So there's two sets of studies. So there is one hyperinsulinemic case, but these

756
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,040
are young, lean people before they've developed any signs of insulin resistance. So VO2 max looks

757
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,440
like it's already a bit of a surrogate marker for early insulin resistance in these individuals.

758
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,640
One of the things that you see is in the normal glucose tolerance offspring that have no signs of

759
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,680
insulin resistance, if you were to measure their ATP output, the ones that just have a family

760
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,240
history of diabetes, their ATP output goes up by like 5%. The ones that basically have no family

761
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:00,200
history at all, again, normal glucose tolerance, it goes up by 90%. So even the earliest stages

762
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,680
before you've seen any signs of insulin resistance, you're seeing significant mitochondrial dysfunction

763
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:09,080
early on. So that's another theory is, is there something at the level of the mitochondria?

764
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,880
And it's hard to predict, is this really something that's happening because of the increased influx

765
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,760
of free fatty acids, this overwhelming beta oxidation, or is there something intrinsically

766
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,240
wrong with oxidative phosphorylate genetic expression? So that's another theory.

767
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,600
This is one of my favorite topics today actually is what is our best proxy for

768
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,880
mitochondrial function. And right now, outside of having a laboratory where we're going to do

769
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,640
mitochondrial biopsies and complicated in vitro assays, what we're using is a zone two fitness

770
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:48,840
test. And so rather than look at VO2 max, which is by the time you're at VO2 max, you are both

771
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:57,240
anaerobic and aerobic. You've in theory, maximized your aerobic capacity, but you've also now brought

772
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:06,440
in a lot of anaerobic metabolism. So what we're interested in is using lactate as a proxy to clamp

773
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:12,760
lactate and figure out what maximum ATP production looks like. And the higher that number, then I

774
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:18,200
think we can say more comfortably, the more mitochondrial efficiency you have, the healthier

775
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,720
you are. So let me give you a practical example. You basically have to do this on either a treadmill

776
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,280
or a bike. You could potentially do it in a rowing machine, but it's harder to sort of clamp the power.

777
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:34,840
So let's just say you want to do it on a bike. You would ride against a fixed load of power in watts,

778
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:41,000
and you sample the lactate level. And so you do long stages. So unlike a VO2 max, where you're

779
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,440
doing typically three minute stages and you keep ratcheting up by 25 watts until they fail,

780
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,280
because there you're measuring in real time what their VO2 is. But lactate has a bit of a lag

781
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:59,480
because you're measuring it as a finger prick. So you might do 10 or 15 minute stages, and you have

782
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,440
gradual increases. And what you're doing is generating this lactate performance curve. And

783
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,840
what we think, and I say we, I mean, I'm talking about the people who are doing this sort of testing

784
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,200
that I'm learning from, one of whom I'm actually going to be interviewing hopefully soon in the

785
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:18,680
podcast, is looking at how much output can you generate while keeping lactate in this sort of 1.7

786
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:24,200
to 1.8 millimolar range. And certainly once you're over two, you're starting to escape the

787
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,800
capacity of the mitochondria a little bit. It's hard to do lactate threshold testing, because even

788
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,920
there it's very complicated. If you develop the whole curve, you can't really tell someone's

789
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,880
lactate threshold until you can follow them all the way through to full threshold, aerobic

790
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,840
threshold. But this is below that. The point I want to make is if your lactate threshold is sort of in

791
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:49,880
the 3.8 to 4.2 millimolar range, this is definitely below that. And this proxy really

792
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,360
matters. So we call this what is your zone two? And so if one person can generate 200 watts

793
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:02,440
while keeping lactate below 1.8 and another person is generating 140 watts while keeping

794
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,320
lactate below 1.8, well, that's a fundamental difference in mitochondrial performance.

795
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,320
And so I think that one, training that system, which makes more sense to me than training VO2

796
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,040
max, training that system, again, I'm going to do an entire podcast on this, so I don't want to go

797
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,760
too far down this rabbit hole, but we're using three hours a week as the magic number in that

798
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:29,880
zone. So three, one hour or four 45 minute sessions at that intensity. But again, you have to know what

799
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,680
it is. And it's empirical. Like I test my lactate on every single one of those sessions. But of course,

800
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,400
I'm a freak. You don't have to do that. But even every two weeks to upgrade and figure out if

801
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,680
you're moving in the right direction. And again, you can do it on a treadmill. Now for me on a

802
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,760
treadmill, I actually use a very steep incline and a brisk walk. The proxy that I've noticed for

803
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:54,440
patients is if you don't want to buy a lactate device to check your finger, like your finger sticks,

804
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:01,880
a poor man's proxy is zone two at this level is about the highest level of exertion at which you

805
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,680
can carry out a conversation. Yeah. That's a decent proxy actually. Yeah. It's not that far off. I

806
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,480
sometimes take phone calls while I'm doing my zone two bike rides because I'm on a stationary trainer

807
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,040
and they're uncomfortable phone calls, but not impossible. I could probably do a podcast on it

808
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,800
because I'm asking more questions than I'm answering. I'd like to hear that podcast. That'd be fun.

809
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,520
Right. So anyway, long-winded way of saying, look, I think that there is definitely something to it.

810
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,160
I wonder if looking at zone two would be an even more sensitive indicator than VO two because

811
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:35,480
VO two, you can train that when I used to ride a bike a lot and I knew I had a VO two max test

812
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,640
coming up, I could game the system, which is for about a month before the test, there are certain

813
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:46,840
types of intervals you can train that really allow you to blow up. Plus you drop a little bit of

814
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:52,440
weight because it's very dependent on your weight. And so you could go from 60 to 70 on a VO two max

815
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,680
in a week, maybe not a week, but probably in about three weeks, you could literally have that much of

816
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:02,600
a jump in VO two max just by managing your weight and a couple of types of workouts. But this zone

817
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,920
two test takes longer. It's a little more robust. And also I think it's not diluted by the anaerobic

818
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,960
piece that comes in VO two max. That's really eloquent. Yeah. Stepping back to lifestyle changes,

819
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,160
and I'd like to get your input on this as well. But in my experience, I got to see in the early

820
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,560
days, because I was seeing so many thin limbed Asians or phenotypes of insulin resistance and

821
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,320
skinny folks that I was pushing weightlifting quite a bit on them. And I think it still makes

822
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,960
a lot of sense for them to just generate more leg strength and more glycogen parking space.

823
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,800
But what I've also realized over time is many of them, although they did well initially,

824
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,560
because they were just so focused on weight training that they did become more deconditioned

825
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,800
from a cardiovascular perspective. And I think that really had an impact on insulin resistance,

826
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,040
in some cases a plateaued or we just were not able to get through glucose tolerance where we wanted.

827
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,840
So I'm finding now that I'm having to sort of go back and say, okay, we need to incorporate some

828
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,920
low intensity steady state cardio or some hit training. And it's a delicate balance,

829
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,480
because one thing I would tell you is when my patients that are really into endurance running,

830
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:04,840
in specifically my Asian population, I find that they're much more catabolic when they do too much

831
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:09,160
endurance training. So many of them that are racing for half marathons, they lose a lot of muscle mass

832
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,000
from doing that. And we know based on studies and athletes that if you do a certain volume of

833
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,400
endurance training, you are going to probably have AMP activated protein kindness inhibition of

834
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,080
mamtor, you're going to see some of that happen. But I think in these populations, that threshold

835
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,320
is low, they go into muscle, I see it myself, if I do a lot of endurance work, my legs, my pants

836
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,800
start getting looser, because I lose leg mass very easily. So finding that delicate balance of yes,

837
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,400
we've got to build up your aerobic system, but we don't want to compromise your muscle mass is sort

838
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,080
of critical. So and I see that different in different ethnic groups. Yeah, that's interesting.

839
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:42,840
You would definitely have more experience than me with both South and East Asian populations. My

840
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,080
view is because I do get asked the question all the time, what's more important, strength or

841
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:52,440
cardio? And my first response is a glib one, which is yes. And my second response is I don't

842
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,160
even know what that means. To use the term strength or to use the term cardio aren't really

843
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,120
helpful because they're so vague. And you have to be specific. It's sort of like saying what's more

844
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,120
important food or water? Well, it totally depends, right? So and strength does provide a lot of

845
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,800
cardio benefit as we know, too. So it's not a black and white thing. Yeah, I mean, even just the

846
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,640
concept of strength training can mean so many different things to so many different people. So

847
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:21,880
my view is if you care about living longer and again, not everybody should. Maybe not everybody

848
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,560
does. I don't want to shove my framework down everybody's throat. But if you want to take the

849
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,720
long view and you actually care about making it to your 80s and 90s and performing really well,

850
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:37,480
being a super functional member of your family, your community or whatever it is that matters to

851
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:45,400
you, you absolutely have to be visiting at least four different components of exercise. The first

852
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:50,680
being stability. So this is the one that's most sorely missing. And it's the one that is the root

853
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:55,720
cause of most injuries that people have. And it's the one that is actually the most interesting to

854
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:01,160
me. So it's basically the ability, it's restoring the body to its natural ability to transmit load

855
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,560
across the muscles preferentially and not the joints. But doing that is that's a whole new way

856
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,360
of training that we won't get into today. The second is strength. But again, what does that mean?

857
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:15,080
And it's because you can have different types of strength, but the most important ones are going

858
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,040
to be the simplest ones, which is the ability to hip hinge, the ability to pull and the ability

859
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:25,640
to push. And all of those things require enormous stabilization. So if you do those things without

860
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,320
being stable, you get injured. So anyone who's doing those things and is hurt by them means

861
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,760
they're not stable enough to be doing them yet. So you have to go back to square one, which is build

862
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,240
the stabilization. But everyone should be hip hinging, pushing and pulling. And everything else

863
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,080
is gravy. If you want to do some bicep curls on top of that, knock yourself out. But at the end of

864
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,760
the day, it's push, it's pull, it's hip hinge. And those things have to be done, in my opinion,

865
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,040
by everyone. Then you move over into this quote unquote cardio world. And there are many energy

866
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:59,560
systems. And this is where I think people confuse the difference between athletic performance and

867
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:07,560
training for life. So if you're training for a 5K at the elite level, that's a 15 minute race.

868
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:13,480
That's an energy system. That is a person who is running slightly above lactate threshold,

869
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,800
and then well above lactate threshold. That's basically what that race looks like. If you're

870
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,640
running a marathon, which again, at the elite level, you're talking about two hours and 20

871
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,440
minutes, two hours and 30 minutes would be incredibly elite. That's a person who's running

872
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:34,360
below lactate threshold until the very end. The question is at the level of quote unquote normal

873
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:40,200
people, people who aren't getting paid to run 5Ks and getting paid to run marathons, which I think

874
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,600
is pretty much everyone listening to this. You have to ask yourself what matters the most. And

875
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,720
in my view, at that point, you can simplify the problem greatly. You have to be very aerobically

876
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,680
efficient, which comes back to this zone two area. And then you have to have some anaerobic

877
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,080
performance. And that's where the high intensity interval training comes in. You don't actually

878
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:05,400
need much of what's in between because the what's in between is very sport specific. So I think

879
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:12,200
aerobically and anaerobically at peak, I'm in reasonable shape today. But my middle zone,

880
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:17,400
what would be called my functional threshold power or in cycling, they call it sort of sweet spot

881
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,760
around that zone. For me, it's deplorable today, but it doesn't really matter because I'm not

882
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,320
interested in doing a race that's one hour long anymore. I'm not racing at anything,

883
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,920
but I don't need to train the system that is geared towards that. Now, there are going to be

884
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,960
people who push back and say, no, you need to be robust across every one of these energy systems.

885
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,600
And maybe that would be true if we had infinite time. But if you have finite time and you have to

886
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,600
prioritize, and one of the things I do with any of my patients who are interested in this exercise,

887
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,760
and several have taken me up on the offer, is I like to do an inventory of time in your life,

888
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,480
which is there are 168 hours in a week. Let's talk about how many of them you're sleeping.

889
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,880
How many of them are you thinking about and or preparing meals, all things that have to do with

890
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,880
food? How many of them are you meditating? How many of them are you exercising? And how does each

891
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,200
hour of exercise fit into those four buckets of stability, strength, aerobic and anaerobic?

892
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,800
And again, for most people, it's like 12 to 14 hours would be the upper limits of what they can

893
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,840
put into exercise. And if that's the case, then I feel you've got to be laser focused on that.

894
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,760
But I definitely want patients to accept the fact that it can't be one or the other. You can't just

895
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,600
go down one path or the other. And there I think you do have phenotypes. I think there are some

896
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,960
people who just doing strength training can do pretty well. Some people who are just doing,

897
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,000
and again, I hate the term cardio, but just to make it a simple term, who can do pretty well,

898
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,280
but I've never met someone who doesn't do better when they're putting them together.

899
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,040
Yeah, in these Silicon Valley companies where I go, a lot of these individuals that have come

900
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:48,280
from other countries, I mean, they have never even grown up doing organized sports. So they don't

901
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,520
have any infrastructure balance or stability. And then they'll join some sort of corporate boot camp

902
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,040
class. And I've seen Achilles tendons get ruptured. I've seen rhabdomyolysis. And I've talked to HR

903
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,280
about the fact that these individuals are not ready for this. And it's an intensely competitive

904
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,280
environment. You're next to a European, an African-American, someone that's got an athletic background,

905
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,960
you're trying to stay up with them, but it can create all types of joint dysfunction. So coming

906
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,560
back to your point about just stability and core and these things, you've got to look at the picture

907
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,160
holistically. One issue I see is with aging in the Asian population. It's a pretty fatalistic

908
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:24,040
outlook. When you look at individuals that reach age 50 or 60, because their leg strength is so

909
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,520
compromised, they're already walking slower, they're using a cane, they don't even think about the

910
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,120
possibility of how they can be so much more independent if they were able to train that

911
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,800
system. But you think again, coming back to our issue about how ethnically they've already got

912
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,960
smaller limbs. And then if you've got insulin resistance on top of that, I kind of think of

913
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,560
insulin resistance as also being anabolic resistance because you're not able to really

914
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,520
accumulate muscle mass as well as you could. It really creates a pretty depressing picture of how

915
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,680
individuals age and become depressed later on in life. So one of my things that when I give talks

916
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:57,800
to multi-generational sort of audiences is really focusing on leg strength and balance. I mean, if

917
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,120
they could just spend their time doing that. And then with my busy execs in Silicon Valley types,

918
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,760
the ones that just will not add time to their schedule, I'm like, how do you integrate these

919
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,240
activities while you're at work? So can we get you in there's apps and tools that I use that can

920
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,640
measure your squats, you know, I kind of measure that as a vital sign, can we do this many squats

921
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:20,280
by 12pm? Can you do this sort of stretching? Or can we do some balance exercises then for stress

922
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,960
management, a lot of them refuse to meditate, they're not going to spend the time to do it.

923
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,120
So what I do is with my Apple watch, a lot of them were Apple watches, or they've got a Fitbit

924
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,880
where they can track their heart rate. And I teach them how to breathe in ways that can actually

925
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,800
bring down their heart rate. So I sort of call this active meditation. When you're in a meeting,

926
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,840
what is your average resting heart rate? And I don't know if you've done this before, but it's

927
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,160
interesting. When I commute to work or I'm sitting in meetings, I think I'm calm and I look at my heart

928
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,240
rates like 20 points above my resting. And then I just breathe through that and all of a sudden the

929
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,760
number comes down. A lot of my patients that have done that throughout the day, they brought their

930
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,120
blood pressure down dramatically because now they're breathing their diaphragm doing a lot of things

931
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,360
like that. And once they get that concept, they're like, this is something that makes a difference.

932
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,680
Maybe it is worth me doing some mindfulness or maybe it's worth me doing more exercise. So it's

933
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,120
kind of a hack that I use for the individual. You've got these patients are like, there's no

934
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,280
inhaling, we're able to add 20 minutes to my day. Well, I'm like, what can we do during your day that

935
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,560
can actually be more impactful that might prove the case that this is meaningful?

936
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,080
Yeah, a lot to unpack there. So it's funny, there's a guy I follow on Instagram. I don't

937
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,120
know him, his name's Ben Bruno though, and he's completely, he might be like one of the best

938
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:26,360
Instagrammers ever. He's just so funny. And I saw that he had a t-shirt that said every day is leg

939
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,320
day. And I was sort of bummed because that's something I like to say. And I was like, Oh,

940
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,520
I would have loved to have made a t-shirt of that, but he already thought of it. So I should just buy

941
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,720
his t-shirt. But I kind of agree with that ethos, which is every day is leg day. So for me, it's like,

942
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,480
I'm going to lift three days a week and I'm going to be on my bike or a treadmill four days a week.

943
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,040
So seven days a week, I am deliberately doing something that is working my legs. I mean,

944
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:51,160
they're climbing hills on a bike and I'm always hip hinging. So every one of those three days in

945
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:56,680
the weight room has a hip hinge. It's a deadlift, a leg press, a Bulgarian or something like you just

946
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:02,760
have, I wish I had less strong legs said no one ever at the end of their life. So completely agree

947
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,520
with you on that. But again, I want to reiterate, if you try to do that stuff without cylindrical

948
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:13,160
strength in the middle of your body, your host, your host, you're just going to get hurt. So you're

949
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,720
going to hurt your back. You're going to hurt your hips. You're going to hurt your knees. It's

950
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:20,280
interesting. Again, I think what you're describing vis-a-vis the heart rate is kind of a poor man's

951
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:25,480
biofeedback. Some people that are more slick will use heart rate variability, but heart rate is a

952
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,680
first order approximator of that. And certainly if you can lower your heart rate from 80 to 60

953
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,280
sitting in a meeting, you're doing something correct. Right. Exactly. And it's actually an

954
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:38,280
elegant way that you do it, which is you use that as a thin end of the wedge to make the broader

955
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:43,160
case, to make change. I've never really personally looked at meditation. I shouldn't say that. I think

956
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:48,600
I used to look at meditation as a tool to reduce stress. Again, I have a bit of an issue with that

957
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,600
terminology because I don't know what that means anymore. Is stress the external things that are

958
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:02,440
stressors to me or is stress how I'm responding physiologically to those things? And while I think

959
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:09,160
certain types of meditation, specifically mantra based meditations, probably do more in the moment

960
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:15,320
to improve those things, my internal bias is really towards mindfulness, which is a view

961
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:21,400
mindfulness like I would view going to the gym. It's just a training tool that often is uncomfortable

962
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:26,600
and oftentimes is unpleasant, but it teaches me a tool that I carry with me when I go elsewhere.

963
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:32,360
So sometimes I don't want to deadlift, but deadlifting makes it easier for me to pick things up

964
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:37,720
when they fall down in my backyard. And similarly, sometimes I don't want to meditate, but the

965
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:43,640
deliberate practice of this ability to observe thought and not react to it and instead examine

966
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,960
it more closely and distance myself from it to see the thought rather than to be the thought. That

967
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,840
just turns out to be a more valuable tool to being less miserable in my life. My predisposition

968
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,560
is just to be a miserable human being. So then meditation becomes a tool out of that. And I think

969
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,680
that's where a lot of people miss the point on meditation is it's mostly just a tool to be less

970
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:07,080
unhappy. Yeah, agreed. And as much as that's desirable. Yeah, absolutely. And I think you

971
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,480
brought up a key point. A lot of individuals think stress reduction means that you're magically going

972
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,120
to eliminate external stress. So when I do a lot of seminars, I talked to individuals and about the

973
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,680
fact that all of us sitting in the room have X amount of stress. But a certain percent of

974
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:24,440
individuals in this room are going to get high blood pressure, glucose abnormality, some sort

975
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:29,400
of chronic health condition as a result of that. So if we can train our systems to not be as reactive

976
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,320
and responsive to that external stress, that's really what we're looking for. And the heart rate

977
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,400
I know is a black I used to do a lot of HRV monitoring early on. But the heart rate just makes

978
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,560
the case that my God, you can do something and actually influence your own physiology. And

979
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,280
there's other ways I mean, when you wear a continuous glucose monitor, I don't know if you've

980
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:48,600
ever tracked the fact that when it's elevated, have you ever noticed after mindfulness or doing

981
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,600
something that's meditation based, have you been able to influence your glucose? No, but the opposite

982
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:58,040
is absolutely correct. So it's very easy because I think it's much easier to raise glucose than to

983
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:06,920
lower it. Yeah. So there's no question that I can be in a distressful situation, get angry about

984
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:13,640
something and then watch my glucose go from 90 to 120 in a matter of two minutes. I mean, that is not

985
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:20,840
at all an uncommon finding. And that is again, yet another awesome feedback tool for me to be

986
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,720
reminded of, oh, wow, you let that whole thing get to you and look at the price you're paying for it.

987
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,560
Exactly. Because most of my patients are left brainers. I mean, I can't go through the usual

988
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:33,560
sort of meditation mantra based talk. But first, I'm like, what are left brain things that we can

989
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,440
do? Is it glucose? Is it your heart rate, your HRV? And once you make that case, then you can sort

990
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,600
of buy them into other types of practices. So you've written quite a bit about sort of energy,

991
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,240
fatigue, stress management, you have something the five S's that you've talked about. Yeah. So

992
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:53,400
basically, if we focus on and things like stress, sedentary activity, sleep, these core habits,

993
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,160
because many of my patients that come in that have been exposed to my work, they're very focused on

994
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:01,160
sort of the diet exercise axis, but the other elements have been sort of ignored, meaning

995
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,360
they're interested in those things even before they come to you. That's sort of their bias.

996
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,120
Well, it is because a lot of them have read my book, or they've watched my videos. So that's the

997
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,880
part that they can focus on the most, the ones that have not been exposed to my work at all,

998
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:15,560
I've got to start from scratch. But many of the individuals that have at least got that down to

999
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,960
a foundational level, they tend to put the stress and sleep on the sideline. And I'm sure you've had

1000
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,840
patients before too, where they literally just want you to add an exercise or tell them what to eat.

1001
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,200
But the minute you bring up the stress where their eyes glaze over, right, they don't want to even

1002
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:33,080
hear or deal with that at all. So I've had to find sort of innovative ways and practices that they

1003
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,480
can use to sort of incorporate that in their lives so they can make more of a meaningful impact.

1004
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:42,360
And so focusing on those other esses has been sort of key. And one thing that has really happened

1005
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,440
in my practice is a lot of my patients bring their family members in. So one thing about Indians in

1006
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,800
particular, they don't like to come alone to their visits, they'll bring their spouse, they'll often

1007
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,280
bring their parents or their in-laws. So I sometimes have four or five people in the room. And man,

1008
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:58,440
Peter, those can be some pretty intense sessions, because initially it starts off quiet, I hear about

1009
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,000
what the issue is, and then ask a couple of probing questions. And all of a sudden, all the family

1010
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,160
tension comes out. Because what I'm not realizing is when I see a patient individually, they come

1011
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,160
out nodding their head, they've got my prescription and plan. But what I realized on the back end is

1012
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,920
there's a mother-in-law at home that's doing all the cooking or a nanny, or there's a family member

1013
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,400
that's visiting for six months that's causing tremendous amounts of stress. So when you see all

1014
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,280
the generational elements, you realize that, wow, this is much more challenging than just looking at

1015
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,840
one individual. And if you can engage that whole family unit, and it's interesting, because of all

1016
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,920
the multi-generational issues, I can talk about the fact that, you know what, this daughter, this

1017
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,800
teenage daughter's got PCOS, dad's got coronary artery disease, you've got pre-diabetes, this is

1018
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,360
a spectrum, basically, right? This is insulin resistance across different lifespans. And it's

1019
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,360
pretty powerful, because when they get that concept and how it manifests with these different conditions,

1020
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,560
they realize that they've got to make multi-generational changes. Otherwise, if you just

1021
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,280
focus on one individual, it sort of gets lost in them. And how often are you seeing PCOS?

1022
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:58,840
So I don't see many teenagers in my practice. But the interesting thing is when I talk to parents,

1023
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:03,800
adults, and I mentioned PCOS, A, either their daughter's got it, or when I go through sort of

1024
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,840
the checklist of symptoms, they're like, they probably have it. And I've talked to some

1025
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,600
endocrinologists who've said in different parts of the Bay Area, and Fremont in particular,

1026
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:15,160
they're seeing probably 25 to 30% of Asian Indians probably have some manifestation of PCOS.

1027
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,680
What do you think is the root cause of it?

1028
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,840
So again, coming back to insulin resistance, I actually just like you hate the word type 2 diabetes,

1029
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,160
I hate the term polycystic ovarian syndrome, because I really think insulin, it should be

1030
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,680
called insulin resistant ovarian syndrome, because I think really it's coming from,

1031
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:33,640
again, hyperinsulinemia. So really the effects of insulin on the ovaries, particularly the

1032
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,040
fecal cells is causing the testosterone release, and that's leading to all the different manifestations.

1033
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:43,400
And for teenage girl, aside from all the issues with type 2 diabetes and heart disease later on,

1034
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,840
for these teenage girls with facial hair, with obesity, with acne, with emotional disorders

1035
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,160
from this condition is absolutely devastating. And when I look back at my childhood, I kind of

1036
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:57,320
remember having family friends that a lot of guys would make fun of, because they had facial

1037
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,800
hair. And looking back, I can already peg in my memory, at least a half dozen girls that I grew up

1038
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,880
with that probably had PCOS, but they had no idea.

1039
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,000
No one knew what it was called.

1040
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,960
Nobody knew what it was called.

1041
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,360
Yeah.

1042
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:12,920
And how much of it do you think is insulin versus IGF effect? I don't see it in my practice very

1043
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,400
rarely. But it's one of those things that always somebody in your practice has a friend or a

1044
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,800
relative. So it sort of tangentially comes across my radar, but I'm quite naive.

1045
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,840
I mean, basically, when we implement the insulin sort of management strategy through lifestyle,

1046
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,000
in many of these cases, we see it reverse. So I think IGF definitely plays a role. But again,

1047
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,080
if you implement a lifestyle that's going to lower insulin levels and improve insulin resistance,

1048
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,600
many times we see them get off medications. It's so reversible in so many of these cases,

1049
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,360
which makes it even more convincing to me that insulin resistance is really a major root cause.

1050
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,040
But I'd have to look deeper in the literature to sort of look at, is it more insulin or IGF?

1051
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,480
There might be some overlap between those.

1052
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:51,160
There's another phenotype. Here's this idea I'm sort of working on, which is

1053
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:57,400
you have one category of adiposity, which is pure excess energy intake. Give someone access

1054
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:03,000
to unlimited food and give all the hedonic pleasures that come with it. There's a phenotype

1055
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,920
of adiposity. There's a subset of people whose bodies will auto correct and reduce intake.

1056
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:14,760
And I suspect most of us would not. In other words, if you put me in an office with unlimited

1057
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,000
or put me in the rat cage with unlimited food, I'm just going to get obese. And it won't matter

1058
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,080
a whole heck of a lot what macronutrient composition you're giving me. By the way,

1059
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,960
I don't know that that's necessarily true for me because I know from being on ketogenic diets,

1060
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:34,280
if I eat an unlimited quantity of purely ketogenic food, I actually get leaner. So I know there's

1061
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:38,520
something regulating in me that will sort of control intake, but that goes out the window

1062
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,880
if you give me unlimited access to M&Ms. I can't regulate that. So then you have sort of,

1063
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,600
let's just loosely call that sort of the diffuse energy abundant intake. We're not going to go

1064
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,120
into that. Lots of people have talked about that. The second phenotype, these are the people that

1065
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:57,160
really respond well to carbohydrate restriction. They are generally the hyperinsulinemic phenotype.

1066
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,920
So you take someone who has adiposity coupled with hyperinsulinemia, even though by the way,

1067
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,360
I think a follow-up study by Christopher Gardner did not find this, though his first study,

1068
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,400
a disease study did find this, I could offer reasons or critiques of why I think the follow-up

1069
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:20,120
study did not find this. Clinically, I still see it. Hyperinsulinemic people respond very well to

1070
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,360
true intermittent fasting, which is real periods of fasting and carbohydrate restriction. They

1071
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:29,240
respond really well. Then you have another group of people who don't seem to respond to either of

1072
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:37,000
those two. They're usually female and not male, by the way, and you reduce calories and or carbohydrates

1073
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,280
and or add fasting. And it doesn't matter. Their metabolic rate continues to slow to match whatever

1074
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:49,720
you do. Now the PCOS throws in another layer of complexity, but let's assume you've already,

1075
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:56,520
this person does not have PCOS. This phenotype, I find, is the risk of oversimplifying. They're

1076
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:04,200
the sleep stress dysregulated group. And the only way I've been able to move the needle for that type

1077
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,080
of patient is the following. You still have to do all the blocking and tackling on all the nutritional

1078
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:14,440
stuff. You can't back off that. So you're still doing some amount of time restricted feeding,

1079
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:19,080
some periodic fasting, carbohydrate restriction. You're doing all of the right nutritional things.

1080
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,320
Oh, we're also sort of loading them up with monounsaturated fats, reducing saturated fats.

1081
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:27,320
But they have to sleep eight hours a night. They have to exercise every single day.

1082
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:33,480
And you have to figure out what it is that is driving their stress. And sometimes it doesn't

1083
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:38,680
even manifest over hypercorticillemia. And then on top of that, it takes a long time. So then you

1084
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:45,000
have to get them to buy into that strategy because if they don't get results in a month,

1085
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,920
the tendency is to give up. But if you look closely, they've lost four pounds in a month.

1086
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,760
And they might on the surface think, well, it's only four pounds, but you realize, no, no, no,

1087
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,920
you don't understand. You're going to potentially lose 25 pounds in a year if you keep this up,

1088
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,840
but you have to stay the course. It's a very stubborn. Oh, and the other thing is they

1089
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,640
generally have high inflammation. Yes. And it's not sky high. It's just fibrinogen is a little

1090
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,280
elevated. CRP is not normal high. Right. And there's some thyroid dysfunction usually that

1091
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,520
goes along with that. Yeah, interesting. And you're seeing that more at the TSH level or?

1092
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,520
Even pre-TSH. So if you're just checking antibodies already, you're starting to see

1093
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,960
thyroid autoantibody use. And to me, that's already a marker. So you're right. You sort of

1094
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,960
break it down. Is this really more insulin resistance? Is it more autoimmune inflammation?

1095
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,120
And it's tough to sort of make that up, but sometimes those thyroid antibodies can be very

1096
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,680
early marker of autoimmune. And which ones are you looking at? And so I'm looking at your typical

1097
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,080
anti-TPO antibodies and thyroid globulin as well too. So you can pick up on that quite a bit. And

1098
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,000
are they, when you say elevated, do you mean elevated even at the level of what the lab says

1099
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
or even are you looking at upper limit of normal would still be elevated? I'm looking at upper

1100
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,080
limit of normal. So and sort of tracking that. And it's interesting because many of my female

1101
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:55,320
patients, because they've been aware of this, have sort of followed that over time. So we can see the

1102
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:00,280
trends sort of go up before the TSH goes up. So that might be sort of a marker. Other things we

1103
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:05,720
see are just GI dysfunction, a lot of eczema in these patients too. So these are other sort of

1104
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,560
autoimmune manifestations. So you're right, when they have that inflammatory component,

1105
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,000
it makes it very difficult because insulin resistance alone, just fixing that problem

1106
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,960
individually is not necessarily going to protect them from weight loss. And a lot of that inflammation

1107
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,880
causes those fat cells to especially the subcutaneous fat, it looks like it has inflammation

1108
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,280
looks like it has a direct impact on subcutaneous fat in terms of the ability of subcutaneous fat

1109
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:32,120
to really release free fatty acids. So why do we see this more in females? So if I picture every

1110
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:38,040
patient I know that fits the phenotype of that last bucket, they're all women and it's tempting

1111
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:44,760
to say, well, it must be an estrogen and testosterone access issue, but I'm not convinced of that. I

1112
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,120
think those things play a role, but there's something else. And I can't understand why I'm

1113
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,840
just, it could be just small N and I'm being fooled by the relative small sample size, but

1114
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,240
why do you think you're seeing this or I'm seeing this disproportionately?

1115
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,400
I know I've asked myself this question so much, but I think it comes back to evolutionarily. If we

1116
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,960
think about women's sort of procreation purpose in terms of being able to store fat and enough

1117
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:09,000
having fat stores basically for lactation, I think there is sort of a larger amount of subcutaneous

1118
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,800
safety belt for women. And the issue is you're right after menopause, I think that the big problem is

1119
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,800
before menopause, we're not seeing the manifestations with insulin resistance,

1120
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,720
but after menopause, all of a sudden it catches up right away. So we sort of lose that protection.

1121
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,640
But in the early stages when you're in those fertility years, I think that subcutaneous fat

1122
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:29,640
is really helping to propagate basically reproduction. I think that's the main purpose.

1123
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:34,040
But coming back to, I'll tell you why I'm convinced about the stress axis as being a major

1124
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,800
target here is many of my women that have been doing ketogenic diets, they're working out like

1125
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:43,160
crazy. They're seeing no results. Oftentimes I'll go back to India for three or four months. And I

1126
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,760
tell them while you're in India, just forget all the rules, do your best to sort of stick to the

1127
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,080
plan that you can, but let's just monitor maybe your blood sugars a little bit in your body weight.

1128
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,000
And I can't tell you how many people Peter, when they've gone back to India to sort of be in their

1129
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,920
family, they've lost weight and they're eating double the amount of carbohydrates. What's the

1130
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,840
main differentiator? Well, they're back to their tribe, their family, they're probably sleeping

1131
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,120
better, they're eating a little bit less processed foods, but more carbohydrates, but they're just

1132
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:10,040
in their native place now. Whereas when they come back here, they're isolated, they've come back

1133
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:14,120
from a huge family, they're here with all the independent stressors of Western life. And that

1134
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:19,000
is just so more obesogenic. And I've seen so many cases that I'm basically convinced that that stress

1135
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,400
axis is a huge part of obesity. If you had shared with me that story, which by the way, now I've

1136
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:29,400
seen myself. So if I had seen that story and or heard that story five years ago, I would have

1137
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:36,120
come up with 10 other plausible explanations for it. And today I think the one you have offered is

1138
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:41,560
by far the most compelling. I mean, and I don't know why I would have rejected that five years ago.

1139
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:47,320
It's just it's too touchy feely. I can't measure it enough. I don't know what it is, but I do agree

1140
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:54,680
that the effects of how we internalize stress do more damage than I've ever understood. And perhaps

1141
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:59,800
part of why I've rejected it is it's not measurable because it's not just about cortisol. And maybe if

1142
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,640
we could have real time measurements of catecholamines, we might see other signals there. But

1143
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:10,280
yeah, I couldn't agree enough. And the other thing is now that we are tracking sleep so much

1144
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:16,920
more closely, we use the aura ring, which is I think very good at measuring duration and probably

1145
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:22,360
reasonable at measuring stage. Just looking at duration, just forget the staging. And by the way,

1146
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:26,040
for that matter, I think many of the sleep device, you don't have to be your Apple watch. It could be

1147
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,960
your Fitbit. It could be WOOP or any of these things. They're all pretty darn good nowadays

1148
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:35,160
at measuring the duration of sleep. There is a fundamental difference between a patient who is

1149
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,560
sleeping six hours a night and a patient who is sleeping eight hours a night. And what I find

1150
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:46,200
really amazing, I saw a patient yesterday actually who we were reviewing his numbers and we do it in

1151
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:52,760
monthly box. So we say, okay, so for the last 30 days, you average six hours, 12 minutes of actual

1152
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,800
sleep. And he's thinking that can't be right. I'm in bed like, and I said, let's go through your

1153
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:01,960
routine. Tell me everything. What time do you get into your bed on it? Tell me two nights ago,

1154
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:06,680
what time did you get into bed? Okay. What did you do? What time did you get up? And you realize,

1155
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,760
actually, you think you're in bed eight hours. You're not because part of that time in bed,

1156
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,240
you're putzing around reading, you're trolling your phone. Sleep efficiency is horrible. Yeah.

1157
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,120
So that person who's truly getting six hours of 12 minutes of sleep a night, you get that person up

1158
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:26,360
to eight hours of sleep a night and make no other change. It's mind boggling the difference,

1159
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,320
especially if you could do that. Let's see what that looks like after three months.

1160
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:34,040
And so yeah, this sleep stress thing is kind of crazy. One quick thing on sleep too, I just want

1161
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,000
to mention is the correlation that I see, especially in Asian patients and South Asians between

1162
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,480
insulin resistance and sleep apnea. That's been a huge factor. And a lot of what we face,

1163
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,280
even when you screen for sleep apnea, often you are using body mass index criteria, but you often

1164
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:53,640
will find overt sleep apnea with a BMI of above 23. It's a chicken or egg thing. Like is it the

1165
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,200
sleep apnea that's triggering insulin resistance or vice versa, but clearly sleep apnea and intermittent

1166
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:03,400
hypoxia is a major inflammatory stimulus. And often when that has been corrected, whether it's

1167
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:08,840
through lifestyle changes or through CPAP, we often see glucose numbers get so much better. So all

1168
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:14,520
along was really intermittent hypoxia during the night. Do you think that hyperinsulinemia per se

1169
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:20,280
plays a causative role in sleep apnea? That's the controversial question. Nobody knows really what

1170
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,880
starts what my theory would be that it probably does have somewhat of a causative link, but yeah,

1171
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,160
it's very tough to say. And there's a lot of people that argue on both sides of that.

1172
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:35,480
So I lived in the Bay Area 12, no, 11 years ago. I spent six years of my life in the Bay Area. I've

1173
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:41,880
been gone for 11 years. I don't recognize it anymore. So when I'm here, it's just, it's not

1174
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,560
the place it was over 20 years ago when I first came here for medical school. It's clearly one of

1175
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:52,920
the most exciting places in the world. If you're bent is innovation and all the things that come

1176
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:58,120
from here, but it strikes me as a really hard place to raise kids. Probably a lot like New York

1177
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,120
would be, and maybe to some extent like Southern California is. What's the trickle down effect of

1178
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,760
what you're seeing on your patients, on their kids? The way I sort of came about this was,

1179
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:12,360
I still remember a patient family encounter where I had a woman who was 47 and she had a first heart

1180
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:16,520
attack and she read my book, came to see me with her parents and her child. By the way, can I

1181
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,040
interrupt for one second? I do want to come back to this story, but this reminds me of something you

1182
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:25,480
said 20 minutes ago and I forgot to ask you about. Are you seeing an association between the Lp

1183
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:30,520
little a of your patient population, which is much higher than the general population and any of

1184
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:36,360
these other metabolic dysregulators, or is the higher prevalence of Lp little a in your patients

1185
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:40,760
and the higher prevalence of hyperinsulinemia uncoupled? Even though when you look at worldwide

1186
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,480
studies of instance of Lp little a in South Asians, it looks like they are a population that's at risk

1187
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,960
for elevated Lp little a, but I clearly see quite a bit of uncoupling. I checked that number quite a

1188
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,480
bit because some of my patients have a family history of coronary disease, but many of them

1189
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,960
have normal Lp little a's and still Scott high insulin resistance. Definitely there are those

1190
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:02,360
that have elevated Lp little a and the risk is multiplied by that, but I see plenty of cases

1191
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:06,040
where Lp little a is not linked to. So you're not, you're seeing those as uncoupled independent

1192
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:11,080
risk factors. I do. Yeah. And this woman who's 47 with an MI was elevated Lp little a? She was not

1193
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:15,560
actually. She had a family history. Her Lp little a was perfectly fine. Oh wow. Yeah. But the reason

1194
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,960
that the sort of emotional access came up was her parents were in the room and they basically told

1195
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:24,600
us that our daughter, she just cannot slow down. She had this heart attack. She did six months of

1196
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,400
cardiac rehab and she's back to where she was before. And the parents are like, we don't understand

1197
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,840
how we can slow her down. She's a workaholic. She's just burning both ends of the candle.

1198
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:37,240
And then it was interesting cause she made a comment during that visit that mom and dad,

1199
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,840
you guys always taught me never to slow down when I was growing up. You told me to be the best in

1200
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,160
everything that I did. Maybe if you taught me to slow down, then I'd have an easier time now. And

1201
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,600
that was like a moment where I sort of sat back and thought, wow, I've never thought of it that

1202
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:53,960
way that the way we raise our kids early on might actually set a pattern for how much of an accelerated

1203
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:58,440
life or how much of a stressed out nervous system they might have later on. And as I've talked to

1204
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:03,560
more and more families here in Silicon Valley, I'm realizing that it is a lot of the behavioral

1205
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:07,240
patterns that we're instilling. Our kids are kind of setting the foundation for insulin resistance

1206
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,520
and inflammation early on. We see so much fatty liver. I'm starting to see hypertension, adult

1207
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,880
hypertension and teenagers that are just going through their junior year. And that's something

1208
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:20,120
I'd never seen before. And we just realized that a lot of our parenting patterns out here in Silicon

1209
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:23,320
Valley are kind of instilling these sorts of behaviors. And they're already manifesting with

1210
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,320
adult health conditions early on in life. So that's something I'm really, that's why I'm very

1211
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,000
open to having people bringing in their kids, bringing the parents and trying to wrap our heads

1212
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,480
around what is it that's happening here and that academic drive for excellence, the high expectations

1213
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,480
they set. There's one concept I call pyramid parenting where a lot of people that immigrate

1214
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:44,280
to this country, they feel like, okay, if I made it from India to basically work here for a high

1215
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,680
tech company, my child with these opportunities should be able to outdo that they should be running

1216
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:52,600
that company. And that's kind of ingrained. Even my dad, when he came here from a village in India,

1217
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,200
he was like, you know, if I made it here, and I'm a pulmonary critical doctor, you should be running

1218
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,600
your own hospital like that pressure is always there. But we don't realize how much pressure and

1219
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,400
what damage that can do. And even the Asian and Indian population, now that I'm exposed to them

1220
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:10,360
more, we're seeing opioid abuse, we're seeing all types of substance abuses, because they cannot

1221
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,800
deal with the pressure that's being put on their shoulders. So it's turning into quite a crisis.

1222
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,800
My wife and I now give a talk to high tech companies in schools. And it's called basically

1223
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,560
is your child a startup, because we often give the analogy that we often treat our kids like

1224
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,720
startup companies, we back them with resources and funding, we expect them to do great things,

1225
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:29,560
go to Stanford, run this company. And we don't realize that we're not even giving them the

1226
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,720
opportunity to grow up and just be a normal child. And it's having a toxic effect. And as we've given

1227
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,440
this talk, I get emails from so many teenagers about the fact that they feel suffocated. My dad

1228
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,800
keeps showing me TED talks on resilience. I don't know if I can handle this anymore. I just want to,

1229
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:46,360
you know, it's like, where do we sort of draw the line? And it's really had a major impact on my

1230
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,200
parenting, because it's a little bit in my DNA. How many kids do you have? I've got identical twin

1231
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:54,600
boys, and they're 15. So they just they're literally finishing up their freshman year in high school.

1232
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,920
So it's amazing how many stories you hear about what's happening. So I just finished reading The

1233
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:03,160
Coddling of the American Mind. Have you read it? No, no, it's a great book. And of course,

1234
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:09,880
it's dealing with a slightly different issue, which is the title of the book suggests is how

1235
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:20,200
we're basically producing a very fragile gen i. So their thesis is that a lot of this sort of ridiculous

1236
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:25,720
over the top political correctness that we're seeing at a handful of elite institutions that's

1237
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:30,600
I mean, I had to actually skip some of the stories in the book, because they're so upsetting of the

1238
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:37,160
completely extreme responses that some of these students have had towards relatively normal

1239
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,480
behavior. They're talking about this as being this sort of gen i. So it's not the millennial, it's the

1240
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:47,960
I think it's the kids born post 95, actually. And they tie it into a lot of the helicopter

1241
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:53,960
parenting sort of stuff and this sort of overly protective stuff. But what you're describing is

1242
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:58,440
a slightly different variation on that, which is not just that they're being overly protected or

1243
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:04,040
coddled, but overly pushed. Do you think that is just unique to the Silicon Valley or other areas

1244
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:08,760
of equal prominence? No, I think it's pervasive. Silicon Valley is a bit of sort of a phenotype,

1245
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,160
but I think it is pervasive. Because if you think about how we look at our kids for many individuals,

1246
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,920
the kids are an extension of their ego. Like even if you talk to the most modest individual,

1247
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,320
you get them talking about their kids and they can go on for hours, right. And it's funny as my kids

1248
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:25,320
are going through high school, I'm having direct flashbacks into certain moments and stages I went

1249
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:29,400
through in high school. And I think consciously and subconsciously, sometimes we might push our

1250
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,400
kids to do things because we might have suffered something like maybe not being athletic in high

1251
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,520
school didn't get me to be more popular. So now I'm going to push that down my kids. And we're

1252
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,000
doing it with good intentions in mind. But if we don't realize the fact that maybe this individual

1253
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,720
is not inclined to doing organized sports and athletics, me making them feel less because I'm

1254
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:49,880
pushing them so hard to do that can have really devastating impacts. So so I think this problem

1255
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:53,640
exists everywhere. But here in Silicon Valley, that problem is on steroids. And I'll give you

1256
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,280
another anecdote. I had a teenager reach out to me, who is not motivated by school at all. He's

1257
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,520
like a junior. There's a concept of not helicopter parents, but they call him snowplow parents. And

1258
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:06,760
New York Times did an article on this and snowplow parents just pave the way for their kids so they

1259
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:11,560
can go to whatever college. And this student told me that one of his friends who's a total slacker,

1260
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:15,960
what basically has happened is his parents being entrepreneurs, they use the designers and the

1261
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,360
software architects and their company to build an app for him so we can put on his resume that he

1262
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:24,600
basically ran his own startup company. So these sorts of things are happening. So literally,

1263
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,800
people are creating pseudo profiles. And when all this news came up about the Lori Laughlin case,

1264
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,640
and everything that happened, I know it enraged everyone. But here in Silicon Valley, I see

1265
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:37,720
that many of us are creating pseudo profiles of our kids, they're just kids, but we want them to

1266
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:42,280
look like they're early entrepreneurs, or they're stellar athletes, but they're just kids. And many

1267
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:46,360
of us are pulling out the snowplows and sort of creating these expectations. And I think it's just

1268
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:50,200
not a healthy way. I think the whole college admission process is a complete mess. It really

1269
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,640
brings out the worst in individuals and puts too much pressure on the kids.

1270
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,200
I couldn't agree with that more. I guess with my youngest turning 11 this year, I'm hoping we got

1271
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:02,760
a few more years for it to work out some of the kinks before we have to sort of deal with that

1272
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,080
stuff. It's a pretty tough night. What part of the country did you grow up in?

1273
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:08,840
I was born in New York. And then I spent two years there, seven years in Philly,

1274
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:14,440
and then came over to California after that. And so you alluded to the fact that you already

1275
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,840
sensed this from your dad, your dad's an immigrant, and he could still figure out a way to become a

1276
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,680
doctor in the United States. So you becoming a doctor would not be considered an equal achievement.

1277
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:30,040
It had to be one better than that. Do you think that that dynamic has been amplified today,

1278
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,080
or we're just more aware of it today?

1279
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:37,080
I think it's amplified because the possibilities are endless. Literally for my dad, it was like me

1280
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,920
being a physician, that was probably enough. Of course, he wanted me to specialize. I did

1281
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,640
general internal medicine. He was pulmonary critical care. He was like, Ron, you should be

1282
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:47,640
a cardiologist. You're going to make more money and do fine. But here in Silicon Valley, it's not

1283
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:51,560
even enough to be a doctor. It's like doctors here are blue collar workers. When I went looking

1284
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,680
for a house, when our real estate agent found out my wife and our physician, she's like,

1285
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,080
you're not going to be able to find a house. I'm like, what are you talking about? We're both

1286
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,480
doctors. She was right. We're getting outbid by all these high tech employees and things.

1287
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:06,600
So here I think the scale for greatness is so much higher. And I had a neurosurgeon come see me in

1288
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:10,440
the clinic, and we were talking about this, and he's a patient of mine. And he told me that you

1289
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:14,360
would think that being a neurosurgeon would be enough. But my dad sometimes is like, why can't

1290
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,880
you be more like Sanjay Gupta? He has his own TV show and he's written a few books. I'm like,

1291
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:23,320
shit, seriously? This guy's spent so much of his life doing brain surgery, and still his dad's

1292
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:28,440
given him a hard time. I'm sure there's a lot of Atul Gawande stories out there too. Are you just

1293
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:36,040
a surgeon? Why can't you be like Atul? And do you think this is specific to either Asians,

1294
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,720
Southeast or East Asians? Do we see this with Caucasian families the same way?

1295
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:44,120
We do when I used the word Asian, we should put quotes, air quotes around it, we can call

1296
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:48,600
an Asian form of parenting. But here I see it, for example, with a lot of individuals of other

1297
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,720
backgrounds in sports, they invest so much time and hours and resources into their kids,

1298
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:57,640
doing sports. And what we see and often I see this in the clinic and during talks is a lot of

1299
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,320
these kids, they're not really growing adequately because they're spending so many hours of their

1300
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,480
day training, they eat a garbage diet because they're running between math, tutoring, sports

1301
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,480
and all this. So I think everybody has sort of their own dream. Like for some people, it's their

1302
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,600
dream to have their kid win the spelling bee. And for others is to be like a top notch runner

1303
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:18,040
soccer athlete. And if they've got the motivation, the resources, and you can do that in a balanced

1304
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,600
way grade. But many times what we're seeing in high school is they have so many activities that by the

1305
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,880
time they come home, and they're doing their homework, they're going to bed at like one or

1306
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:30,120
two in the morning. And that's something for us, we do not compromise bedtimes. Like we hear from

1307
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:33,080
other parents that you know what, in high school, your kids are gonna have to go to bed at two in

1308
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,840
the morning. But so far, they're just freshmen, maybe that'll happen. But I'm like, usually those

1309
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,680
kids going to bed that late, they are having other issues, they're not able to organize themselves,

1310
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,200
they're not able to focus on their task. They've got their cell phone next to them. And they're

1311
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,120
looking at my kids have affirmed this. I said some of their friends are watching an episode of Game

1312
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,640
of Thrones at one in the morning, just as a study break. And then they jump back in their books at

1313
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:55,320
two in the morning. So when their parents tell me, Oh, he's got so much homework, I'm like, is he

1314
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,920
really doing a lot of homework? Is there a lot of other ancillary activities happening? So yeah,

1315
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,040
one of the other things that sort of jumped out at me from the book I mentioned a while ago,

1316
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:06,920
calling the American mind is the dramatic reduction in playtime that kids have. And I

1317
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:10,280
don't know, I just think about when I was a kid, I don't think my parents knew what the hell I was

1318
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,960
doing anytime. All we did was screw around. Oh, you were always playing. We played, you know,

1319
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:18,680
group in Canada. So hockey was sort of the only thing that mattered. So all we did was play hockey

1320
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:23,480
all the time. You were always playing street hockey. You're always playing ice hockey. You were

1321
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:27,720
always sort of, or foot hockey. So at recess, you were playing foot hockey, which is just kicking a

1322
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,680
tennis ball around, pretending you're playing hockey, but really playing soccer with a tennis

1323
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:34,040
ball. And then you'd come home and you play street hockey. And then you'd go out and have

1324
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:40,920
ice hockey, organized hockey in the evening. And we never had tutors and we never had exactly.

1325
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:45,000
I don't know. We just, you know, you're bringing up a key point because you did sports for fun.

1326
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And many of the teenagers are getting so much pressure. We must have patients like this.

1327
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,160
There were former athletes, many of them don't know how to exercise for fitness. And the minute

1328
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,760
they leave high school, they're not going to exercise. They're like so burned out on the

1329
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:01,000
structure and the pressure from playing organized soccer or basketball or football.

1330
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,800
They just can't deal anymore. It's not even a source of pleasure. And I want to bring up

1331
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:08,200
the other issue because I think this is key is instilling hobbies. So for example, our kids were

1332
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:13,240
into music very early on, we got them a recommended piano teacher, and this piano teacher basically

1333
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:17,720
had a very structured approach to music. And literally she kind of told us that if they

1334
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:22,600
follow this certification process for piano, they can put that on their college resume. And I didn't

1335
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:26,600
even realize that this even existed. And then we're like, you know what, they're not even enjoying it.

1336
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,200
Let's just get rid of her and let's get them like a rock keyboard instructor or somebody else.

1337
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:34,440
And literally, we brought somebody else in, they taught him how to play Star Wars music, anime,

1338
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:38,840
they love all this stuff. And now for their study breaks, they love playing piano. And I know that

1339
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,840
going forward after college, anytime they're stressed, they're going to play music. My roommate

1340
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,720
in college, he went the track of falling piano for college admissions. He's never touched the

1341
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,680
piano since because all he has memories of is just the pressure of performing, having to fill out

1342
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:57,400
these evals and scoring on exams for piano. It's like we're taking the joy out of a lot of things

1343
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:01,320
that should be hobbies that we use for stress reduction later. We've got to really be aware of

1344
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:05,240
that. Yeah, I get pretty stressed out actually just thinking about being a parent. I think it's,

1345
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:09,800
I probably need to visit this topic more on the podcast because there are lots of books I'm reading

1346
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:14,360
on this topic and they're kind of depressing actually, because of a lot of these trends that

1347
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,520
you see. So you have to separate out the sort of societal trends that we're seeing, which almost

1348
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:25,160
without exception or in the wrong direction. There are some exceptions to that. And then balance

1349
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:29,560
that with, well, what do you do as a parent? Because in the end, all I've got is control over

1350
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,480
some control, not even complete control. Of course, I have some control over three kids.

1351
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:38,440
And then there's this piece which says, well, you can ironically screw that whole thing up by trying

1352
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:43,720
too hard to do the right thing. Like, okay guys, it's time for more unstructured play. Let's go

1353
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:48,920
outside and not play in a structured way and go. You know, it's just like, you're right.

1354
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,840
So one skill that we know that we need to teach kids that's going to lead to their happiness is

1355
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:57,720
their ability to look internally and sort of cognitively reframe situations. So when they're

1356
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,200
dealing with stress, so one key thing is when I've talked to therapists here in Silicon Valley,

1357
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:06,920
they tell me that watch out for the kids that are quiet when they're too quiet. If they're

1358
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,600
not really interacting, they're not talking to you, they're just following the rules

1359
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:14,040
compliantly. Those are the ones you have to watch out for. And what's the reason? Because

1360
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,800
they're ruminating. They have nobody to express their emotions to. So they're internally thinking

1361
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,280
about these things day and night. Having two boys, both of my kids, they naturally sort of

1362
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,680
had that habitus of being more internalizers. So we've had to instill activities and again,

1363
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:30,520
do it in sort of an undercover fashion to make sure that they're expressing their emotions. So

1364
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:35,800
one exercise we often do sort of covertly is called roses and thorns where we sit around the table

1365
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,000
and we'll sort of go through and talk about a few good things that happen, a few bad things that

1366
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,320
happen. So I read about this. And again, I sort of tried the exercise. My kids were like, oh my god,

1367
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:46,520
dad, you're just doing another one of these things. But then what I started doing was they weren't

1368
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,680
really coming out. I started really sharing my frustrations. Like I'm like, you know what,

1369
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,920
I had the situation at work that was really tough. I've got this coworker, I've got this boss. And

1370
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:58,840
they saw me just unload stuff. And then all of a sudden my boys were like, I got a teacher just

1371
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,960
like that. Or I got a coach just like that. So one really powerful thing is the more you can express

1372
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:08,520
your emotions, your kids find out that, okay, you're not this dogmatic top down dad just telling you,

1373
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,360
okay, watch this TED talk, do this. You've got your own issues that you're struggling with.

1374
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,400
And now there's so much more comfortable sort of open up. And from an early age,

1375
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,840
I've actually seeked out the advice of my kids. And I'm like, what do you think I should do in

1376
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:22,360
the situation? I've got this challenge coming up, what should you do? And you get some really

1377
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:26,840
insightful advice, but it also makes them feel like this is a company and we're equals a lot of

1378
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,280
parents that struggle with their kids, they come and you sing my kids don't listen. I'm like,

1379
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,720
do you like working in a company where your manager tells you what to do 24 seven? Would

1380
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,600
you like to work in that company? And they're like, hell no. I'm like, well, that's how your

1381
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:40,760
kid feels because day and night you're telling them, don't do this, do this, give them some

1382
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,920
ownership, tell them that how can they participate in these decisions? And how can they help you as

1383
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:48,200
well too? And it's just much more empowering and it's an undercover way. You don't have to have

1384
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,280
these forced rituals, like you said, where you can get eye rolls from teenagers, but you can sort of

1385
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:57,560
do this throughout the day. Do you have a point of view on phones and the age at which that starts

1386
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:03,560
to become less harmful? Like to be clear, I wish I didn't have a phone. I'm convinced that it is,

1387
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,120
although it comes with tremendous benefit and obviously I can't imagine not having one or I

1388
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:13,240
wouldn't at this point, but I think it's a very harmful thing that I bring with me. And my view

1389
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:18,760
is I want to delay my kids having that as long as possible. Do you have a view on that?

1390
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,720
So I don't have a hard number for it, but I look at the phone as literally being a drug or a toxin.

1391
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:28,200
And you have to see that basically if your kid is a type that is really consuming a lot of media

1392
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,640
and other forms, I'm not going to give them a pack of cigarettes. This is just something you need to

1393
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:36,280
delay as much as you can. Luckily and honestly, this is not, I mean, we sort of got lucky because

1394
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:40,600
we sort of didn't expose them to much media early on. We focused more on hobbies and playing things

1395
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:45,480
like that. So they don't really get much stimulation from digital devices. But we did

1396
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,640
eventually end up sort of giving into it around middle school or in seventh or eighth grade,

1397
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:53,160
because what we realized is a lot of their kids are talking about stuff. And unfortunately,

1398
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:56,760
the school they were at, they had an open phone policy. So many of them are looking at stuff and

1399
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,400
they're socializing using their phone. And we didn't want our kids to be standing sort of isolated,

1400
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:06,120
not be sort of part of that. So we had a very long discussion about what the phone's for. And we sort

1401
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:09,240
of introduced it at that point. And at least there's a lot of stuff that's probably going on,

1402
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,600
Peter, I don't know about, but I feel like when they're doing homework, their phones on the

1403
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:16,920
charger, they're not using it at all. But for some of their friends, I mean, literally we carpool

1404
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,840
with some of them and they cannot keep their fingers off the device. If that was my kid,

1405
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:24,360
I'll either take the phone away or implement some more harsh restrictions on that. So I think you

1406
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:27,640
have to customize it rather than go by, okay, by this age, you should introduce it.

1407
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:31,880
So if you're providing advice to some of your patients, what does that spectrum look like?

1408
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:36,200
Because I'm guessing that given how thoughtful you are about all these things, your patients are just

1409
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:40,120
as interested in your views on parenting as they are on hyperinsulinemia.

1410
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:44,520
Yeah. So if I do seminars and talks on this, I'm very hard nosed about this, Peter. I think we're

1411
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:48,360
living in a world right now where we're just sort of, we've kind of normalized this whole thing.

1412
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:52,040
It's kind of like back in the days, I think you've talked about this where we knew cigarettes were

1413
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:56,680
bad for us, but hell, people were smoking any, my dad was a pulmonologist who smoked. I remember

1414
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,480
going to lung cancer conferences were in the hallway, pulmonologists were smoking cigarettes

1415
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,720
after looking at slides of lung cancer biopsies. I mean, that's how it was. This is just a few

1416
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,960
decades ago. And I feel like we're living in an era right now where people just casually talk about,

1417
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:13,800
yeah, my kid was on this social media platform till two in the morning. They just kind of joke

1418
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,800
about, oh yeah, he's hooked on the device. But it's scary what it's doing. I mean, we definitely,

1419
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:22,600
when I really dig down in these family sessions, they always identify the phone as being a major

1420
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,720
cause of just conflict in the family, attention deficit stuff, so many issues. So I laid out,

1421
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:31,400
I'll show them the neurochemistry, I'll show them the dopamine pathways, the fact that what's

1422
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,200
happening, social comparison, you talked to Dr. Przywulski about this and the impact of what's

1423
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,520
happening there, when you talk to these kids, especially girls in particular, the social

1424
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:44,360
comparison that happens at that level is just amplified to a different level altogether in

1425
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:48,120
terms of subtle messaging like, oh yeah, we showed up at this party and then all of a sudden you're

1426
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:52,360
not included in that. It's really a difficult line we're treading right now. So the parents need to

1427
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,600
be aware of that and we need to sort of set some boundaries. And when parents give me pushback and

1428
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,120
they're like, you know what, I have no control of it. I tell them, well, let's say your kids sitting

1429
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:03,640
at home and they decide to light up a cigarette. Are you just going to sit there? And they're like,

1430
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:07,400
no, of course not. I'm like, well, you have to look at this as being pretty analogous to that

1431
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:11,160
because because of this device, they're going to bed late, they're having social issues. This is

1432
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:14,440
something we need to take seriously. So you've got to kind of reframe it because like I said,

1433
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,120
the normalization of this digital media use has made it something that people are not taking

1434
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:22,040
seriously enough. And I was actually in the process of starting a not-for-profit called Data,

1435
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:27,240
Doctors Against Tech Addiction. I wanted to get CEOs and entrepreneurs from high-tech companies,

1436
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,760
physicians. It's on my to-do list, but it's something my wife and I are totally passionate

1437
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:34,520
about. I feel like we need to expose this more. Man, well, I hope at least one person listening

1438
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:38,520
to this can bring something to help you guys on that. Yeah, I'd love that. We'll make it easy for

1439
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,040
people to reach out to you. But going back to this point, because again, I'm obviously very

1440
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,440
personally interested in it, but I just know from because our kids aren't there yet, but I have so

1441
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:54,120
many patients whose kids are there, how much of this is a substitution effect versus a regulation

1442
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:59,320
of the thing. Let me give you an example. If you have someone who's smoking, there's the regulatory

1443
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:04,680
environment around making it harder to smoke, like we're going to charge more money. We're going to

1444
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:09,800
place restrictions on where you can smoke. But the other side of that is what's the root cause

1445
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:14,760
of why you're smoking? Oh, there's a bit of anxiety. Well, look, why don't we give you something else

1446
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,600
to do that's scratching the itch of that? So I don't know if that's the right analogy, but when

1447
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:24,680
you think about the quick hits that we get from social media, the sort of, I don't know, I mean,

1448
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,360
I think there's more reasons than I can count as to why we find these things so addictive.

1449
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:34,360
If you're dealing with your kids and let's say your kids were really struggling to put that phone

1450
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:40,200
away, how much of it would come down to just restriction versus bringing other things into

1451
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:44,440
bear? I think the latter point, you're right. Once you develop a confrontational relationship with

1452
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:48,520
that kid, then obviously them using the phone as a way for them to rebel. They're going to want to

1453
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,680
consume that media even more. So I think these are the areas where if you've got a bit of a

1454
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:57,160
combative relationship with your child already, this is where you've got to introduce and add

1455
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:01,560
things. So this is obviously if their idle time is focused on a media device, what other things

1456
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,760
can they do with their idle time? Like what are the other hobbies? What are the other things we

1457
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:08,280
can instill? And I'm not saying that you're going to cut out the phone completely, but this might

1458
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:12,200
be a sign that all of us in the house need to sort of address this. And as you know, a lot of these

1459
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,640
kids have got parents that can't get off their phones either. And we say that, oh, yeah, it's for

1460
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:19,640
work all the time, but it's rarely ever anything life threatening. A lot of us have to sort of model

1461
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:24,360
that. I've had some parents come to see me and I've told them, you know what, just don't even limit

1462
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:29,080
their time. But for 10 or 15 minutes, can you guys do this sort of activity? Can you go for a walk?

1463
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:32,920
Can you do a hike? And just kind of naturally compress the time that they're on the digital

1464
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,480
media device because you've introduced other types of activities. Because then at least their brain's

1465
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,600
not being exposed to the media as much. And they're finding that, wow, there are certain things that

1466
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:44,600
we're doing that are actually enjoyable that don't involve the device. Just a weekend ago,

1467
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,440
camping sometimes when you get their friends together, we tell our friends usually when we

1468
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:52,920
gather, let's have a rule already that no devices during the next 12 hours when we're out at this

1469
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,840
camp. And it's good to find this is the other thing Peter will find is if you've got some friends in

1470
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,600
your circle that sort of agree with that approach, it makes it much easier because then you can have

1471
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,400
dinners, you have friends come over and you're like, guys, let's just have the kids not bring

1472
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:06,920
their phones or put in a basket and let them just play outside. Does everybody agree? And usually

1473
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:10,440
people will. There might be a couple, they're like, okay, why you know, it's their own life,

1474
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,560
but but you want to surround yourself with more and more of those types of people.

1475
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:17,480
I can't think of a better way to end this podcast than on that note, Ron, this has been really

1476
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:23,880
interesting. I think we've talked about this before, but your experience is disproportionately with a

1477
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,640
group of people who are under a lot of stress, who have a genetic predisposition that doesn't

1478
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:38,040
enable them to at a metabolic level, tolerate the insults that maybe others do. But that gives you

1479
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:43,240
a window into what we would call a model system in biology that I think the applications of which

1480
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,920
are much broader. I think the work that you're doing and the way that you're communicating and

1481
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:50,920
sharing it is just an incredible value. It's a resource to me personally, and therefore by

1482
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,720
extension my patients. But I think given that I'm kind of a nobody with a very small practice,

1483
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:00,280
I think more broadly, that's a huge application. And in fact, to people who can take care of

1484
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:05,000
themselves, the reality of it is so much of what you do and what I do, you don't really need a

1485
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,920
doctor to do for you. A person who there are now resources out there, whether it be podcast books

1486
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:16,520
that allow a person enough information to work on their sleep, to work on their management of

1487
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:21,320
their own distress, their nutrition and these other things, that in some ways people like you

1488
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:26,840
and I are more there for accountability. And then some of the nuanced stuff around the diagnoses and

1489
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,480
maybe ordering the interventions a little bit. But actually, I wanted to highlight, I think you

1490
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:35,000
bring up a key point because I have a lot of patients to see me who are engineers and they

1491
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,920
often tell me, I wish I went to medical school because I could do what you could do. And then

1492
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:42,520
I kind of remind them, you know, the burnout rates of medicine are about 50%. So it's like,

1493
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:46,680
it's not that going to medicine would solve this problem, but you can still make a huge impact on

1494
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:49,960
the lives of your co workers, your family, just with the knowledge you've gained. And that's been

1495
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:54,040
one of the most rewarding thing I think you know, from your audience to the many individuals have

1496
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:58,120
gone out and they've made an impact on their community, they've become sort of the evangelist

1497
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:02,200
for health, and you don't need an MD, a PhD for that, you can do that. And that to me,

1498
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:06,440
as much as I do all these activities, I get no more gratification. The most gratification is if

1499
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:10,280
I have a one on one interaction with the human being, and I can make an impact on their life.

1500
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:14,360
And you don't need special fancy degrees, anybody at any stage can do that. So I'm glad you call

1501
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:18,280
that out. You really don't need to have advanced degrees to have this sort of meaningful interaction.

1502
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:22,520
Well, thanks so much, Ron. I really appreciate it. And again, look forward to it. Where can

1503
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:26,280
people find you? What's the easiest place for people to find you? Do you spend much time on

1504
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,960
social media that we've just talked about? Is it easier for them to look at your books? Do you

1505
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:34,280
have a blog? So the best way is through the blog and just click on the email icon and I answer all

1506
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:40,680
my emails. And the blog is? Just put my name, Ronish Sinha.com. R-O-N-E-S-H Sinha.com.

1507
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,480
And we'll link to all of that stuff. Awesome. It's been an honor to be here with you,

1508
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,640
