00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:14,680
All right, Bob, we got a pretty fun AMA today here. But before we do, I don't think I realized

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,840
until looking at your background that the Boston Bruins had a 30-year drought in which

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,480
they did not win their division. 1940 to 1970.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,800
Oh, I'm glad I missed that drought. Was that when there were fewer teams?

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,480
Oh, yeah, there was only 16.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,280
Really embarrassing.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,160
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's not as embarrassing as the Maple Leafs, who haven't won the Stanley

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,480
Cup since, I think, 1967.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,520
Oh, my goodness.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
Well, if any team deserves a Stanley Cup, it's Toronto.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,840
I enjoyed it. I think I sent you a video of a guy talking about, you know, that's bad enough,

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,080
but was it a year ago or a couple of years ago? They lost to a backup goaltender who was a Zamboni

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
driver for their-

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,840
Yeah, at the ACC.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
... from Toronto Maple Leafs. Yeah.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,920
That's a beautiful story, though.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
Yeah.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,040
All right, so we've got a pretty fun topic, an important topic on the docket today, which is

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,960
effectively kind of scratching the exercise itch as it pertains to longevity, but at a probably a

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,680
deeper level than folks are used to. So where should we start?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,280
I think we should start with, well, aerobic fitness or cardio- respiratory fitness,

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,280
because I think we've got a few things that these questions have come in. I think a bunch of

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,880
questions related to this, which is studies that look at how much lean mass you have and whether

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,720
that is a predictor of longevity. And then there's also studies that talk about muscle strength,

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,200
not just muscle mass and whether that predicts longevity and whether one of those is better than

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,760
the other. But I think a good place to start is with cardio- respiratory fitness, with similar

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,600
question. You know, does better lead to less mortality and does lower cardio- respiratory

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,200
fitness lead to higher mortality or is it at least associated?

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,280
Okay, so let's start by kind of explaining to folks the metrics that we're going to talk

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,000
about through this. So the most common thing I think we see in the literature is either

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,320
METS-metabolic Equivalence or VO2MAX. And I think part of that is it's quite objective.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,160
So if anybody's had a VO2MAX test, they'll understand how objective and unpleasant it is.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,120
I think we've talked about this before, so you are hooked up to an indirect calorimeter. So it's a

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,040
device that provides complete occlusion around your mouth and your nose. Typically this device

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,800
also sort of plugs your nose so you're only breathing through your mouth. And the important

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,920
thing is that the device has two sensors on it. One sensor measures the concentration of oxygen

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,480
that is being expelled. And for the purpose of this discussion, that's the more important of the

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,200
sensors. But for what it's worth, the other one is also measuring the concentration of carbon

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:14,600
dioxide that's expelled. So because we know the concentration of oxygen and CO2 on the way in,

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,640
by knowing what comes out, and obviously oxygen will be lower, CO2 will be higher,

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,000
we know how much carbon dioxide was produced and how much oxygen was consumed. And knowing those

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,680
two things gives you a flow rate of VO2 and a VCO2. Those two pieces of information alone tell you

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,560
how much energy you're utilizing via something called the Fick equation, if I'm not mistaken.

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:56,760
So total energy consumption is 3.94 times VO2 plus I think it's 1.11 times VCO2 at any point

46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,960
in time. So if you have for this minute, VO2 was this, VCO2 was that, you apply it to that equation

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,560
and it will tell you, you were utilizing 10 kilocalories per minute, which would be 600

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:19,560
kilocalories per hour. Which is, I do this sometimes when I'm doing my zone two. My zone two

49
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:30,920
tends to be about 780 kilocalories per hour. So interesting, but again, that's not how I test

50
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,760
zone two, I'm using lactate for zone two. But now what we're talking about is something different,

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:43,320
which is what is the maximum utilization of oxygen? So if you make somebody work harder and harder and

52
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,040
harder, so if they're on a bike and you keep adding wattage to the bike and they have to pedal against

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,120
more and more resistance, or if they're on a treadmill and you make them run faster and faster

54
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,040
and up at higher and higher incline, at some point they will reach a maximum, at which point they can

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:07,000
no longer utilize more oxygen. Now we're not going to go into the why right now, but I believe that

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Alex Hutchinson and I covered that in some depth in our podcast, you may recall. And we talked about

57
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,960
some of the alveolar limitations, how much of that is being limited at the gas exchange surface,

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,920
versus how much is being exchanged in the actual, pardon, how much of that is being limited in the

59
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,760
muscle. But regardless of which of those it is, and it's possible it's a combination, or it's

60
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,360
possible that at low levels of fitness it's more in the muscle, and at high levels of fitness it

61
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:44,360
might be more in the lung. But that number is the VO2 max. When you're doing the test, it's

62
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:53,000
measured typically in liters per minute, but then we normalize it by body weight. So we normalize it

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,280
as liters per, well we do it actually as milliliters per kilogram per minute. So when you start to hear

64
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,720
the numbers that people kick around, the fittest of the fit are going to be north of 80. But what

65
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,960
does that mean? It means they're north of 80 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram per minute. And

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,120
I think actually Alex and I talked about that on the podcast, right? The highest ever recorded

67
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:29,320
person was probably about 96 or so. And any sort of elite athlete, elite cardiac type athlete,

68
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,800
so runner, cyclist, rower, those sorts of athletes, they're generally going to be above 70.

69
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,680
So what does that number tell us about mortality? I think that's a question. And I think we've got

70
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,000
some data to talk about that. So do you want to pull out one of these slides here? Yeah, let's

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,720
pull it up. All right, I've got to slide up now. Okay, so this took a group of people. Do you recall

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:06,440
how old they were? I don't, but I'm looking right here. Let's see, about 53 on average.

73
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Okay. All right, mean age. So and it ran them through a VO2 max test and then it ranked them.

74
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,680
And low were people who scored, I believe in the bottom 25th percentile. These are non-equally

75
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,680
weighted groups if my memory serves me correctly. But I think that low were the people in the bottom

76
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,200
25th percentile. Check me on that. Below average, I think was 25th to 50 percentile and then 50 to

77
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:43,640
75th percentile was above average. And high was like 75th to maybe 95th. And elite was just that

78
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,400
top 5%. I'm probably off by a little bit, but directionally, that's true. I just want to make

79
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,120
sure people don't look at these and think that each of them represents 20% of the population.

80
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah, I think that's directionally accurate. I'm looking at the table one,

81
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:04,120
their patient demographics. It's interesting. So it's a total of 122,000 patients. And if you look

82
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,240
at the low, below average and above average and high, they're all about 30,000 participants in

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,480
each one of those groups. And then you've got the elite and there's a little over 3,500 versus the

84
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,560
30,000 that's split amongst those other groups. Got it. Yeah. Okay. So that's about what we just

85
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,600
said there. Okay. And we're looking at all-cause mortality here and you can see a pretty clear

86
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,960
trend. So two things stand out, right? The two things that stand out are there's kind of a

87
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,520
monotonic relationship between fitness and mortality. But the second thing that stands out is by far

88
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:51,480
the biggest gap is between the people in the bottom 25%, which are categorized as low fitness

89
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,720
and basically everyone above them. So if you go to the next figure, Bob, I think we get to see

90
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,160
this in a little bit more detail. Yes. Yeah. I like this figure frankly more because it allows

91
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:13,640
us to see a bit more interesting stuff. So here we can see both for all patients, so lumping

92
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:22,680
everyone in together, male and female, if you have low fitness and then comparing it to everybody

93
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,520
else, what's the risk reduction? So if you go from low to below average to above average to high to

94
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:39,000
elite, you can see what is the hazard ratio. So it's interesting, going from just being low to

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,120
being below average is a 50% reduction in mortality over a decade if you're starting in your fifties.

96
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,480
We're going to come back to that, but that is so important, right?

97
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,280
It is. It seems like a weird message to give to somebody that, I want you to be below average,

98
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,320
but that is definitely a step up from low in terms of how they categorize these.

99
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:12,360
That's right. If you then go from low to above average, it's about a 60% or 70% reduction in

100
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,480
mortality. And it just continues monotonically to increase. Again, the lowest improvement

101
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,240
is going from high to elite. That doesn't buy you a whole heck of a lot.

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,280
It is still statistically significant. And to see that, you have to look at

103
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,680
figure C. Again, this is going to be one of those podcasts where it's really going to be better to

104
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,600
watch this over video because the data just speak for themselves. And of course, the show notes are

105
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,640
going to include all of these. So make sure you're looking at this. But remember the hazard

106
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:02,120
ratio for mortality is the reciprocal of the hazard ratio of risk reduction. So tables A and

107
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,360
C are basically showing you similar things in the group comparison. So again, when I said that going

108
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,440
from high to elite didn't have as much of a benefit, you can see it has the smallest hazard ratio of

109
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,760
improvement in benefit or the reduction going from elite to... Sorry, going from high to elite.

110
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,720
It's 29%. But notice that the confidence interval does not cross one and therefore the p value is

111
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,840
less than 0.05. Now, here's what's interesting. What they've done, and you can see all of these

112
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,920
listed, right? So if you compare someone of low fitness to elite, it is a five fold difference

113
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,960
in mortality over a decade, which is pretty remarkable. And that's what they show you above.

114
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,480
They give you context. They put this in the context of other things that we commonly understand

115
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,240
as being problematic for mortality, namely smoking, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes,

116
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,480
hypertension, and end stage renal disease. So look at these differences, right? And I believe, Bob,

117
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,240
this is not just for someone who's currently smoking. This is if you've ever smoked, right?

118
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,680
Yes. I think it was previously used or used tobacco. So they're really looking at

119
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,320
the difference between never smokers. So you've never smoked in your lifetime to if you've ever

120
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,720
smoked. Okay. And that's a 41% increase in mortality over the decade. Coronary artery disease,

121
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,560
29%. Diabetes, 40%. High blood pressure, 21%. And the most of all of these things,

122
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:44,280
end stage renal disease, about 280% increase in mortality. Now we all understand what that means,

123
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,240
but now when you compare that to these, the differences in these fitness levels, it gives you,

124
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,400
at least in my opinion, a greater appreciation for how much improvement in mortality comes

125
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,160
from improving your fitness. So if you look at the biggest driver of mortality,

126
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,520
which would be end stage renal disease in this cohort, it's the same as going from low

127
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,920
cardio respiratory fitness to above average cardio respiratory fitness. So going from the

128
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,320
bottom 25th percentile to being in the 50th to 75th percentile, which is a totally achievable

129
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,640
feat as you'll see in a moment. Anything else you want to say about this, Bob,

130
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,640
aside from the fact that it's sort of stunning? It is. It's really striking. So one little pro

131
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,480
tip or amateur tip is when Peter was talking about the Peter was talking about the reciprocals

132
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,800
is that if you look at figure two, a, and then you look at figure two, C, and you look at the

133
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,600
group comparisons, if you want to see those, that plotted point, for example, on the way on the

134
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,120
right hand side of figure two, a elite versus low, you can take that you can look at figure two,

135
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,320
C, where it says low versus elite and the hazard ratio is five. You just take the mean, the

136
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,600
reciprocal is just take one divided by five and you get, but you get point two. And then if you

137
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,600
look at that, so then when you look at the chart, it seems it, it makes sense. And then high versus

138
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,800
low, for example, it's 3.9 for hazard ratio, which is about four. So one divided by four is about

139
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:19,720
0.25 that checks out. So just a little pro tip for the fans out there. And that's, that's helpful

140
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,800
because these graphs have a log linear axis. So it's not intuitive to look at these things,

141
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,000
you know, going from low to below average gives you half of the benefit, but you'll never get the

142
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,120
remaining half ever because that would imply immortality, which obviously isn't happening.

143
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Okay. So now let's put some numbers to this because this is one of those things that we use

144
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,680
a lot with our patients because we want most of our patients, we want all of them doing this, but

145
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,120
not all of them are willing to do it, but we certainly want everybody to have a VO two max

146
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,040
test so that we can kind of benchmark them on their way to their centenarian Olympics. So let's

147
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,480
actually see what these numbers look like. I think there's another graph here, right?

148
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,880
Thank you for listening to today's sneak peek AMA episode of the drive. If you're interested

149
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,920
in hearing the complete version of this AMA, you'll want to become a member. We created a membership

150
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,000
program to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads. Membership

151
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,720
benefits are many and beyond the complete episodes of the AMA each month, they include

152
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,040
the following ridiculously comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic, paper, person,

153
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,040
and thing we discuss on each episode of the drive access to our private podcast feed. The

154
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,840
qualities, which were a super short podcast, typically less than five minutes released every

155
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,480
Tuesday through Friday, which highlight the best questions, topics, and tactics discussed on

156
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,080
previous episodes of the drive. This is particularly important for those of you who haven't heard all

157
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,880
of the back episodes, becomes a great way to go back and filter and decide which ones you want to

158
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,160
listen to in detail. Really steep discount codes for products I use and believe in, but for which

159
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,920
I don't get paid to endorse and benefits that we continue to add over time. If you want to learn

160
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,800
