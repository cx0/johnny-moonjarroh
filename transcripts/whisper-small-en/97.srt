00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia. This podcast,

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,380
my website, and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content in

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,440
health and wellness, full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
far more in-depth content. If you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,560
At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are. Or if you want to learn more now,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,840
today's episode. My guest today is Dr. Peter Hotez. Dr. Hotez is a renowned vaccine scientist,

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,680
pediatrician, and an expert on the current coronavirus outbreak. His titles are almost too

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,920
numerous to get into at this point, but I'll make an attempt to do so. He's the Dean of the National

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,320
School of Tropical Medicine and professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,720
at the Baylor College of Medicine, where he's also the director of the Texas Children's Center

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,560
for Vaccine Development and the Texas Children's Hospital Endowed Chair of Tropical Pediatrics.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,400
I learned of Peter a few months ago for unrelated reasons that pertained to microbiology,

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,360
vaccination, et cetera, and had wanted to interview him at the time and postponed it for a number of

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,920
unrelated reasons. More recently, about three weeks ago, I saw him talking about coronavirus,

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
which was really around the time I started to think I had miscalculated. This would have been

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,200
mid-February, the second week of February, and I started to realize at that point in time that this

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,600
was going to be a much bigger deal than I had naively assumed in January. I reached back out

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,400
to him and said, Peter, let's get on a podcast when the time is right and assumed that that would

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,560
mean when we had enough facts that it was worth talking about. But what I did not really anticipate

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,360
was the past seven days until they were upon us, basically about a week ago. So if you're

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,160
listening to this on the 14th of March, that would have been about the 6th of March. A lot of things

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,520
really changed in my mind. And I reached back out to Peter and said, hey, we should probably talk

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,360
at the end of next week, which gives you enough time to manage the very important responsibilities

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,960
that you have, but also allows us to sort of fill in some pretty big gaps in knowledge. And we attempt

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,440
to do that, and this podcast is actually quite short by the standards of our podcast. It's about

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,120
an hour long. And I think what we'll probably do is shorter, more frequent podcasts at this point in

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,920
time because the information is changing at a very rapid rate, such that anything we talk about

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,520
on this podcast is likely to be background information at best a week out. So we do talk

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,960
about a number of things. We talk obviously about the etiology of the virus, the difference between

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,280
the virus, which is SARS-CoV-2 and the disease state that it causes COVID-19. We talk about how

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,880
it's spread. We talk about where it came from, what we know about it, what we don't know about it,

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,000
what some of the treatment options may be, may not be, why a vaccine is probably not likely in

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,200
the near term. We talk about something called convalescent serum, which is something that looks

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,360
kind of promising. And at this point, anything promising, we want to put sort of all hands on

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,640
deck with interpreting. So with that said, let's just get to this interview with Peter, and we'll

39
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,480
be following this up with a number of other interviews. Also, I should point out on pretty

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,920
much every day I'm putting updates up on Instagram, where you can find me at PeterAttiaMD.com is the

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
website. And that'll point you to Instagram, or you can just go to Instagram at PeterAttiaMD. And

42
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,800
that'll be kind of daily updates. But as I said, expect to see podcasts at a slightly irregular

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,040
cadence, just as a way that we can sort of communicate with you. This podcast and all podcasts

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,640
pertaining to the coronavirus will have show notes available to all listeners. So these podcasts,

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,160
show notes, and the subsequent ones that pertain to this subject matter will not be behind the

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,840
paywall for subscribers. So this will be available to everybody. We will attempt to provide show notes

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,120
as quickly as we can. So hopefully that allows everyone to access this information without any

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,920
bottleneck. Without further delay, then please enjoy my discussion today with Dr. Peter Hotez.

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Peter, thank you so much for making time to speak with us. You're in unbelievably high demand. I saw

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,600
you on the news at 5.30 this morning, your time, and I don't think you've stopped since. And of

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,560
course, you've been nonstop for weeks now. And you've been very generous in making time to speak

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,040
with me and my team prior to today. So again, greatly appreciated on behalf of many people

53
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,720
listening. Let's start with a little bit of just the nomenclature. People are a little bit

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,600
confused, I think, about the nomenclature between COVID-19, SARS, COV-2, maybe explain which one's

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,680
the virus, which one's the disease and what the history is here.

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Sure. COVID-19 is official designated name of the disease by the World Health Organization. The

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,040
causative agent is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, SARS Coronavirus 2. Just like there's AIDS and there's

58
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,080
HIV, there's the name of the disease and the name of the virus. And the fact that it's called

59
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,840
SARS-2, as I often like to call it, has some meaning because there's a lot of similarity in

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,120
the type of virus it is compared to the original SARS, which I often call SARS-1 that originated

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,120
out of southern China in 2003 and caused a very serious pandemic, a deadly pandemic that affected

62
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,680
Toronto, Canada, among other places. This is a somewhat different type of disease in terms of

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,640
transmissibility and fatality. We can talk about some of the differences between SARS-1 and SARS-2.

64
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,960
Maybe we should do that because I think transmissibility and lethality are two things that

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,040
are very important to understanding this and maybe touching on the distinction between SARS-1 and

66
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,320
SARS-2 will be helpful.

67
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:16,280
Yeah, so actually we've had now three major pandemics caused by coronaviruses in the 21st

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,760
century. You know, up until then, when I was being trained in microbiology and infectious diseases,

69
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,880
we knew about coronaviruses, but they were considered of relatively minor importance. They

70
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,400
were coronaviruses that caused upper respiratory infections in kids and rarely they would cause

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,800
lower respiratory tract infections. But we had our first really serious experience with a

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,200
coronavirus in 2003 when SARS-1 caused a serious pandemic that disrupted the economy of China and

73
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,280
Canada and elsewhere. Another second coronavirus occurred in 2012 with Middle Eastern Respiratory

74
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,160
Syndrome that emerged out of Saudi Arabia. Now it's around 2012 and now this is the third one,

75
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,600
SARS-2. So the point is we've had a new coronavirus pandemic every decade of this 21st century. So

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,960
hopefully we're starting to realize these are pretty serious actors here in terms of global

77
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,680
health threats. And that has a lot of relevance when we talk about ultimately developing vaccines

78
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,520
and why we should prioritize coronaviruses moving forward.

79
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,720
Peter, six days ago I spoke with a colleague of yours who will remain nameless just because we

80
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,760
didn't speak on the record. And I asked him point blank, what is your level of concern today? And

81
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,200
keep in mind, this was a discussion on March 7th, six days ago. I said, what is your concern with

82
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,400
SARS-CoV-2 relative to the coronaviruses responsible for MERS and SARS, which were very

83
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,880
deadly viruses? And he said something to the effect of, I am much more concerned with what I'm seeing

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,440
today. Do you share that sentiment and do you think that that is an overreaction?

85
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,760
I think it is an appropriate reaction. And I would have shared that concern six days ago,

86
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,840
but for very quirky reasons. So you might say, well, everyone knows, or a lot of people know from

87
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:14,760
the from all the public news that SARS-2 is not as deadly as SARS-1 or MERS, but it's a cause of

88
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,240
serious mortality. We'll go into that a little bit more. And it's also highly transmissible.

89
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,880
So while it isn't necessarily the most lethal virus we've ever seen, nor is it the most transmissible,

90
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,680
it's high in both categories. And that combines in this very unique way. Let me explain that a

91
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,960
little bit better. So SARS-1, the original one was highly lethal. And if you had it, you were sick as

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,960
hell and you were going into the hospital in the ICU. And that meant that you didn't have a lot

93
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,920
of people walking around transmitting SARS-1. And that's one of the reasons it tended to burn out

94
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,120
pretty quickly, although it could cause serious nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals and MERS-2

95
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,120
more or less went by that same playbook. This one is fatal only for certain groups,

96
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,440
a serious disease in certain groups. And what that means is you have a lot of other, a large segment

97
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,920
of the population walking around shedding virus, including kids. So kids for reasons that, and

98
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,960
adolescents and young adults for reasons that we don't understand are getting the infection

99
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,240
transmitting the virus, but they're not getting very sick. And there's always the outlier that

100
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,520
will, but more often than not. So the problem is you have a lot of virus circulating and only

101
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:39,160
certain groups seem to be getting serious disease. And those tend to be individuals over the age of

102
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,680
70, those who have underlying disability, including diabetes or hypertension or heart disease,

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,640
maybe those that have immunosuppressive therapy, although we don't know as much about that.

104
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Also quite an interesting healthcare workers. So a lot of healthcare workers are getting infected

105
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
because this is so highly transmissible and they're coming into contact with patients.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And for reasons that we don't understand, healthcare workers are getting a higher level

107
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,120
of serious disease than you would expect given their age groups. There have been a lot of medical

108
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,160
mysteries about this virus, why kids are not getting seriously, why adolescents, young adults

109
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,120
not getting seriously ill, but why healthcare workers are getting seriously ill. So we saw this

110
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,800
in Wuhan in China where this virus emerged, at least a thousand healthcare workers became infected

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,680
and about 15% of those developed serious illness or in the intensive care unit. So they seem to get

112
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,520
much sicker than you would have expected. And whether that's due to a higher level of exposure

113
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,000
or a higher inoculum of virus and whether that is reproducible in the US, we'll have to see. So

114
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,240
those are the people that seem to be the most vulnerable, the very old, those with underlying

115
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,480
disability and healthcare workers. And that also is a perfect mix because you're knocking out a

116
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,800
lot of people out of the healthcare workforce that have to self-quarantine or are getting sick.

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,280
And we were seeing these tragic situations play out in China or elsewhere where

118
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,560
colleagues, healthcare colleagues are taking care of healthcare colleagues in the ICU. And that is

119
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,600
also highly destabilizing. Yeah. And it's also very nonlinear because if you lose 10% or 15% in

120
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,320
that situation of your healthcare workforce between physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, et

121
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,680
cetera, the knockoff effect of that is much more than a 15% hit to the ability to provide care.

122
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,680
So that's right. And then the other population we're seeing at high risk, we're getting sick

123
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,040
are the first responders and the first responders are coming into contact with

124
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,440
very severely ill people. They're getting infected and then they have to self-quarantine.

125
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,200
So we're seeing large numbers of first responders knocked out of the workforce. And then it's going

126
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,560
to reach a point potentially where we're going to have this perfect storm of not having enough

127
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,600
healthcare workers and first responders to help us. And so for all of these really odd features

128
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:12,360
of the virus, it starts adding up to become a very serious epidemic and highly destabilizing

129
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,200
for any country that has large numbers of people. And of course, we didn't help our case at all by

130
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,840
the US being so behind in diagnostic testing and allowing this virus to circulate for long periods

131
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,280
of time. As of today, Peter, do you know how many tests are available? I know that as of yesterday

132
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,120
morning, we were at about 75,000. How long until we hit a million, which in theory was promised as

133
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,920
of yesterday? Who knows? The promises keep coming. And this also has a lot of serious consequences

134
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,120
because my colleague Mark Lipsich has done some nice studies with his doctoral student,

135
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,400
Ruan Li, in China showing that the city's docket hit hard in terms of depletion of healthcare

136
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:05,240
workforce and run on hospital beds and ventilators are those that allow transmission to go on for

137
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:13,320
long periods of time without intervening. So whether or not you're a city that is totally

138
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,080
overrun in terms of having patients on ventilators and hospital beds and depletion of healthcare

139
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,520
staff is very much depends on how quickly you picked up transmission. So in Wuhan, where

140
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,200
transmission went on for six weeks without people intervening, it was a catastrophe. So it was,

141
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,440
and we all heard the stories of what went on in Wuhan and creating 10 cities of hospitals as

142
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,760
opposed to Guangdong where they picked it up after a week and there were 20 people in the ICU.

143
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,360
So it's night and day. And in the US, now we probably think transmission likely began in

144
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,240
the middle of February if our first known indigenous case occurred, I think it was around

145
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,280
February 26th. So back data on five or six days, the average incubation period, we're getting up

146
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,320
there now three, four weeks where transmission has been going on undetected because we haven't had

147
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,800
the testing available. And that's what I'm worried about is in over two weeks from now,

148
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,400
all of a sudden, we're going to see hospitals inundated with large numbers of sick people.

149
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,920
We don't know for sure this is a new virus, but that is the consequence of the failure

150
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,240
that our government has had in terms of getting testing available.

151
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,320
And Peter, that's a really important point that I just don't think can be overstated,

152
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,400
which is coming back to this point of the importance of social distancing now to buy time.

153
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,880
Because if we could do anything at this point, there is no stopping this. The opportunity to

154
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,440
prevent this virus from entering this country or reaching a sufficient number of the population

155
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,960
seems pretty slim at this point. It's a question of if 100,000 people are going to be infected,

156
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,000
and it happens over a year versus a month, that has enormous consequences. Do you think

157
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
there is still an opportunity to shift that curve? If we can get a big order of magnitude level of

158
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,320
testing in the next week, and we can see which communities have significant levels of transmission,

159
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,520
potentially we could intervene. So yeah, we still have to try. But boy, it would have been nice to

160
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,080
have that three, four weeks ago when there was maybe just a handful of communities that had

161
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,840
transmission. We could have focused all of our energy on that. And so we did lose an opportunity,

162
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,800
I think, to prevent this from becoming a large epidemic. And I get asked about this a lot.

163
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,520
For instance, I got Alison Camerata on CNN asked me this morning, whose fault is this? And I think

164
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,720
my response to her was a bit surprising. I said, look, now's not the time to start

165
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,360
assigning fault. There's going to be time for that later. And we can have a federal investigation of

166
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,680
where the breakdowns occurred. But I think right now we've got to focus on what the task at hand is.

167
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,520
And I introduced this new concept this morning, both on CNN and on Fox News. And I did it after

168
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,440
calling my friend and colleague Arturo Casadoval, who's a professor at Johns Hopkins,

169
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,480
who's been pushing this idea for a few weeks that there is a low cost intervention that we could

170
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,520
apply right now. And that is identifying patients who've been infected, recovered, and looking at

171
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,240
their convalescent serous. In other words, people develop antibodies and antibody response to varying

172
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,120
their degrees, collecting that serum, isolating antibody, and then using that as a treatment.

173
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,360
Because that's all we're going to have right now. I already think the window is passed

174
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,000
when we're going to start having significant numbers of people sick from this virus in hospitals

175
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,680
and intensive care units. And this is the one thing we can offer them given the fact that we're not

176
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,440
likely to have any effective antiviral drugs for a while. And it could be very effective

177
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,920
based on what we learned historically from things like the 1918 flu pandemic, the Spanish flu,

178
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,160
or even from experiences that we heard about from SARS and MERS or even this virus and Wuhan,

179
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,320
both as a treatment, which would require large amounts of antibody, but also as prophylaxis.

180
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:28,440
So you can give a small amount and keep healthcare workers and first responders on the job because

181
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,360
it's preventing them from potentially from getting sick. Peter, when it comes to convalescent serum,

182
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,280
I want to make sure I understand something, which is from a technical standpoint, this is easy.

183
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,000
Obviously from a theoretical standpoint, it makes sense. This is, as you point out, not a new trick.

184
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,600
However, when we start to think about bottlenecks in the supply chain, it does require a phoresis,

185
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,640
correct? Yeah, it looks that way. And so we really need the help of blood banks and any,

186
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,080
I don't know if you do this only in academic health centers or whether

187
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,400
every community hospital would have this capability. And we would need some guidance

188
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,680
from the drug administration from CBER, the Center for Biologics Evaluation Research. So

189
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,720
this is kind of a 30,000 foot aerial view of the problem. Speaking to Arturo, he thinks putting

190
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,240
together a federal task force to really look into this and to help with standardizing it and

191
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,760
figuring out what we can do. But if we wind up having a situation similar to Italy

192
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,520
in the United States or even part of the United States, having this at our disposal

193
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,000
is going to be really important because otherwise we've got nothing. Otherwise we go back to the

194
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,840
14th century in terms of using quarantine methods and that kind of thing. And we see

195
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,080
what happens when we have to do that. It's not a good look for our country.

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,040
Peter, do we have a sense of how many individuals could be helped by the serum of one

197
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,960
convalesced patient? How scalable is it? The kinds of numbers people are throwing out are 300

198
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,640
mils, three to 600 mils for someone who's potentially seriously ill. So that looks like

199
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,200
a one-to-one donor per patient. But for the prophylaxis, if we're talking five mLs, a single

200
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,160
donor could potentially prophylaxis dozens or maybe even 100 individuals. And who knows how

201
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:27,080
off those numbers really are. But given the fact that it's relatively low technology, doesn't need

202
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,840
to bring in a lot of specialized equipment, I think it's something we need to look into. And

203
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,840
Arturo gave me the permission to sound the alarm on CNN and Fox News. And we'll see how it resonates

204
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,960
in the coming days and weeks and see if it catches fire. What about remdesivir, which seems

205
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,480
like one of the more promising things that could be repurposed? Do you buy that argument that this

206
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,480
drug, which has been developed by Gilead for Ebola is potentially, I mean, it's being used now on

207
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,280
compassionate exemption. Do we have a sense of its efficacy or is it too soon? I haven't seen those

208
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,360
numbers. And so it will require a clinical trial and whether you use combination therapy, certainly

209
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,200
antivirals will go a lot faster than vaccines. And we've developed a recombinant protein vaccine,

210
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,520
but it's, you know, we'll see how quickly that can come up to speed in terms of clinical development.

211
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,080
You've said in the past, a vaccine is really not something we're going to have in the next 12

212
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,960
months. And it might even be longer than that. Can you just explain to folks two issues? One,

213
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,280
the technical challenges of vaccinating against this coronavirus per se versus say an influenza

214
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,160
and the lessons we've learned from say RSV viruses. And then secondly, the logistics of

215
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,160
getting a vaccine tested, vetted from a safety and efficacy standpoint to be used on

216
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,480
asymptomatic people. Those seem to be two separate issues that are both stacked against us.

217
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,400
Well, yeah, I mean, vaccines are about the highest bar there is in terms of testing because you're

218
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,000
essentially typically you're immunizing well individuals or healthy individuals. So you have

219
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,520
to be pristine in terms of its safety. And historically, it's been very difficult to

220
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,600
compress those timelines to something quick. So it's not unusual for a clinical development plan

221
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:23,720
for a vaccine to last a year, two years, sometimes three years to go through the series of phase one

222
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,920
trials for safety and then graded trials for phase two to show that those are expanded safety

223
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,680
studies, maybe getting a hint of efficacy and then the phase three pivotal study for licensure

224
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,680
in an area of transmission. So even under ideal circumstances that will take time. Now, I think

225
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,720
there are opportunities to streamline this. So my colleague, Rina Rapioli, who's one of the real

226
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,920
thought leaders in vaccines, he's at GlaxoSmithKline has drawn up a lot of interesting roadmaps for

227
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,080
doing more things in parallel rather than serially and accelerating those timelines.

228
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,880
And I think that just a lot of interest in applying that for this vaccine. But I've made

229
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,600
the statement that I'm not sure this is the one you want to do it with even though there's so

230
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,040
much urgency. And the reason I say that is coronavirus vaccines have, at least in laboratory

231
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,880
animals, shown that they could create a problem known as immune enhancement, where the vaccine

232
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,440
could actually make things worse. This is a phenomena that was found originally with the

233
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,520
respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, the RSV vaccine, that was a killed virus vaccine, a formal

234
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,840
and inactivated vaccine that was tested by the National Institutes of Health at Children's

235
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,760
Hospital in Washington in the 1960s, where vaccine recipients actually did worse than the non-vaccine

236
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,840
recipients after they were exposed to the natural virus living in the community. And the

237
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,120
mechanism is not still entirely clear, but those who were vaccinated had more hospitalizations

238
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,560
and there were even two deaths. And there was the added layer of complexity that this study,

239
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,800
when you look at the paper, I only realized this recently was done among almost all African

240
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,680
American kids as well, when it was done in Washington, DC, and there were potentially

241
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,720
two deaths. So this squashed enthusiasm for RSV vaccines appropriately, so for a long time.

242
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,920
And the question is, was this unique to respiratory syncytial virus or is there

243
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,080
others that do it? Well, after SARS in 2003, there was an initial effort to, again, develop

244
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,880
killed virus vaccines to test in animals. And unfortunately, after virus challenge,

245
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,480
those animals also exhibited a lung pathology that bore some resemblance to what we saw

246
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,640
in the kids with RSV in the 1960s. And we said, oh, no, this is, are we going to be faced with this

247
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,080
again? And so the thinking was, well, okay, maybe that was unique to a killed virus vaccine. Let's

248
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,440
do this with the whole spike protein. So if you look at a cartoon of what coronavirus looks like,

249
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,560
you always see these little spikes all around it. That's the part of the docs with the receptor.

250
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,120
So a recombinant protein vaccine was made with the whole spike protein. Sure enough,

251
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,720
we also saw immune enhancement, although it was more in the liver than in the lungs. But the

252
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,320
thinking was, can we get around this? Is it going to be impossible to develop coronavirus vaccines?

253
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,240
Well, then our colleagues at the New York blood center, Shibujiang and Lanying Du,

254
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,520
found that if they only use the receptor binding, no main, the smallest part of the S protein that

255
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,480
docs with the receptor, the acetylcholines 2 receptor in the lungs, they seem to get protection

256
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,960
in laboratory animals without all the immune enhancement. That was pretty exciting. And that's

257
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,560
the concept that we partnered together to write a grant to the NIH together with the Galveston

258
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,200
National Laboratory, where they had the virus for potentially doing preclinical studies. And Walter

259
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,240
Reed, and we wound up making a vaccine manufacturing it that showed pretty good

260
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,280
levels of high levels of efficacy and seemed to get around the problem of immune enhancement.

261
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,760
And that's why we got so excited at the prospect of maybe we could develop this

262
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,760
receptor binding domain as a vaccine. And we did, and we got funded by the NIH.

263
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,240
It took us several years to do it to show all of the safety, none of the immune enhancement,

264
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:38,120
and the efficacy had it manufactured. But after then, by then, nobody was really interested in

265
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,560
coronavirus vaccines anymore. And we couldn't attract any investment in moving into clinical

266
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,920
trials. We kept it on stability studies, but that project more or less was done until a few weeks

267
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,800
ago when this new coronavirus emerged. And we began look in the Chinese were really good about

268
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,520
putting up their data. Everyone says how non-transparent they were, but I disagree. They

269
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,240
were very transparent. They were putting up all their data on these preprint servers like

270
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,880
BioArchive, MedArchive. And we were able to see that the SARS-2 coronavirus bore a lot of

271
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,960
resemblance to SARS-1. It was about 80% similar in terms of its genetic code bound to the same

272
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,760
receptor. We realized, oh my God, we might actually have a vaccine that we could repurpose

273
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,320
for this epidemic. In the meantime, we also started trying to make the new one as well,

274
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,680
the receptor binding made for the new one, but this was already manufactured. And now we've been

275
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,520
in this hunt to try to identify prospective donors to see if we can now move this into

276
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,800
clinical trials. That's been a few weeks now. And it's sad to report we've still not been able to

277
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,320
raise the money to move it into clinical trials, which is really tragic. It's already manufactured.

278
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,840
We can move as fast as anybody, but this really goes to show you the problem of dealing with

279
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,360
vaccines, either for neglected diseases that I've devoted my whole life to. We've made vaccines for

280
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:11,000
schistosomiasis and hookworm and shoggis disease and moving them into the clinic through our

281
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,040
National School of Tropical Medicine, the Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital

282
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,920
Center for Vaccine Development, taking on this coronavirus. But you'd think that people would

283
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,960
be pretty eager to support us to move this forward, but so far it hasn't happened.

284
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,440
Should that change? I assume people can pretty easily get a hold of you if there's interest in

285
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,680
this. What's the easiest way for people to get a hold of you at this point in time? I assume just

286
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,880
through the university? Yeah, just send me an email. My email is pretty public. It's just

287
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,320
Hotez last name at BCM stands for Baylor College of Medicine.edu. And we can do this through either

288
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,640
the college or Texas Children's Hospital and be fantastic. What do we know about the ACE2

289
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,000
receptor and its role here? Certainly a few weeks ago, I remember seeing a paper that

290
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,120
discussed this in the context of the first SARS outbreak. This was a 2005 paper, and that got us

291
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,520
very interested in looking at angiotensin receptor blockers and things like that. But is the

292
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,840
following still our understanding, which is that the virus gains access to these cells in the lung,

293
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,640
the type two pneumocytes that make surfactant, probably through this ACE2 receptor, though there

294
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,520
may be a co receptor. Once the pneumocyte is infected, it reduces its capacity to produce

295
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,960
surfactant, which is one of the more telling pieces of the pathology. Is that still largely

296
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,400
accurate to our understanding? Well, I think there's a couple of things. I think first of all,

297
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,880
the receptors not only in the lungs, it's also found in the intestinal tract, and you can see

298
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,760
intestinal pathology with this. And that may even be even myocardial potentially. And it's in endothelial

299
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,920
cells as well. And that may partly explain some of the diverse pathology that we're seeing. So for

300
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,400
instance, patients who are very ill with this, if you look at the med archive reports coming out of

301
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,760
China and elsewhere, a lot of them are getting acute myocardial injury. And we don't really know

302
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,200
if that's from myocarditis or whether just getting myocardial infarction as a consequence

303
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,160
of the infection. But I think that's probably a major mode of death for a lot of these patients.

304
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,520
And it's very confusing because there's a lot of things going on at once. You have

305
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,840
acute myocardial injury, but you're also seeing acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS.

306
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,560
So therefore, is the heart injury due to the ARDS in shock or is it occurring in parallel? And then

307
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:46,040
what's the basis for the ARDS? Is it overwhelming virus invasion in the lungs or is there a huge

308
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,800
inflammatory component to this? And there's differing opinions on that. And that also has

309
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,400
implications for treatment. Then the intestinal pathology as well. And we've seen patients,

310
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,280
at least 10% of the patients reported in some hospitals in Wuhan, they presented with GI symptoms

311
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,400
and were erroneously admitted to the surgical suite. And those are the ones that wound up

312
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,880
actually infecting large numbers of healthcare workers because nobody suspected this was SARS-2.

313
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,280
So that's confusing as well. And you can imagine how all the confusion that would create for

314
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,640
monitoring and figuring out who should get tested. So my colleague Paul Offit is of the opinion that

315
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,200
he thinks the GI route is actually a major mode of transmission. As noted and speculated,

316
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,040
well, at least he's talked to me on the phone about whether the fact that cruise ships are so

317
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,280
widely affected, he says it reminds him a little bit of norovirus when it affects large numbers of

318
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,480
cruise ships. So is it getting into the food? So we don't really know the modes of transmission of

319
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,440
this. We know droplet contact is going to be important. People are coughing micro droplets

320
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,280
onto surfaces and then people come into contact with them with their hands and auto inoculate

321
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,720
themselves in the mucous membranes of their eyes and mouth or whether they're coughing directly

322
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,200
onto people's faces. But the other modes of transmission are also interesting. Is there

323
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,360
a lot of fecal oral transmission? I don't think we know that. Is there a true airborne transmission

324
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,720
where the virus can travel on micro particles long distances? It turns out not many respiratory

325
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,800
viruses do that. We know measles does, chicken pox does. So we're still in this deep learning

326
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,280
curve about this virus. Which again brings us back to this point of can you buy time? Because time

327
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,240
presumably brings clarity, reduces uncertainty. Did you see the paper today that just came out

328
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,080
from the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at the fomite transmission? No, I didn't

329
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,440
see that. What did it find? Well, here, I'm going to pull it up. The telling figure in this sort of

330
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,000
looks at four different surfaces, actually several plastic, steel, cardboard, copper

331
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:06,040
surfaces. And it looks at the median and half-life survival on these surfaces. And not surprisingly,

332
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,480
I think based on what you just said, Peter, there's pretty reasonable survival. So until you reach a

333
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,400
level that they think is not compatible with transmission takes about 72 hours on plastic,

334
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:27,720
takes 48 hours on cardboard, takes about 24 hours on steel, and takes about eight hours to 24 hours

335
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,080
on copper. So a couple points I'd make there from a public service announcement. There's, I've seen a

336
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,880
lot of talk on Twitter of all you need to do is have copper on your door and nothing gets in.

337
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:46,280
Well, apparently not. And we have evidence that at least a day of survivability on these fomites.

338
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:52,520
And again, I think that speaks to the R0 being as high as it is. And maybe this is a reasonable

339
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,800
time to explain exactly what R0 is and what we think our best estimates are of it and why it

340
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,360
probably feeds into what you've been saying about the concern over the transmissibility.

341
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:10,680
I think all of this put together presents a picture of why this virus is so highly transmissible.

342
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:18,760
You have the fact that this virus can live on surfaces. So the droplet contact motor transmission

343
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:26,200
is significant because it depends on the virus being able to survive on fomites and surfaces.

344
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,720
And the fact that this virus will often land on people's face and they can auto inoculate

345
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,160
themselves, that's a motor transmission, maybe fecal oral and maybe airborne transmission as well.

346
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,400
And so what does that all add up to? It all adds up to the fact that when people have looked at it,

347
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,400
it's a pretty high, what we call reproductive number or what the Brits call R0, what we call R0,

348
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,720
which refers to roughly the working definition is the number of people that will get infected

349
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,320
if a single individual has this virus. So the number that I carry around in my head is between

350
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:12,520
2.24 and 3.58, roughly between two and four people infected for every single individual.

351
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,160
And some people will shift those numbers around more or less. And I think that level of transmission

352
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,840
varies depending on location and number of other factors, but it's pretty high. If you look at

353
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,720
seasonal flu, for instance, which is around 1.2, 1.3, so this would be two or three times more

354
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,960
transmissible than seasonal flu, clearly not as transmissible as measles, which is up to 12 to 18,

355
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,920
but still quite high. So as I mentioned before, every new emerging pathogen has its own little

356
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:53,800
shop of horrors. In the case of this one, it's pretty highly transmissible. And there are a lot

357
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,280
of people in this case who are running around who are not sick that are spreading this virus around

358
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,840
and infecting a subgroup of individuals who happen to get very ill and with very high mortality

359
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:16,840
rates. So the case fatality rate of this virus is between 0.6 and 3.4%, which may not sound all that

360
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,440
high, but that's easily between four and 20 times higher than influenza. And that, given the fact

361
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,560
that there is a group walking around with this, means you're going to have a lot of people in

362
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,200
hospital in intensive care units, and especially among older populations where that mortality rate

363
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,240
is between 10 and 20%. And that's what's so devastating is the fact that when this virus

364
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,320
goes into areas where large numbers of older people congregate, especially older people

365
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,600
with underlying disability, can have some devastating effects. And the Chinese told us

366
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,040
this was going to happen. They told us about what happens when this virus goes into a nursing home

367
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,640
or affects older people and large numbers of deaths of those individuals over the age of 70.

368
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,600
And I don't know if it was because we didn't believe them or we just had to learn it on our

369
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,840
own. But when we had our first community transmission in Kirkland, Washington, we saw

370
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:22,040
how this virus raced through that nursing home and killed 13 people in a nursing home of about

371
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:29,240
100 individuals. So 13%, which is exactly right in that area of 10 to 20% that the Chinese told

372
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,160
us about. And then I became very concerned, not only from the lack of government response from

373
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,000
the debacle with the testing, but also that there was not a lot of guidance being issued

374
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,960
around nursing homes or assisted living facilities. And I had the opportunity to testify to Congress

375
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:54,840
about our vaccine to the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. But I hear I had the

376
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,800
attention of Congress when it was being filmed on C-SPAN 2 or C-SPAN. And I said, look, this is my

377
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,720
chance to really sound the alarm on what's not happening to protect our old people. And as I was

378
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,400
saying it, I knew it was being very provocative and I was being deliberately provocative. And I

379
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,040
knew it was going to be on the evening news and be on the news the next day, but I felt,

380
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,120
no, I had to say something. And that's when I used that expression, this is the angel of death

381
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,200
for older people. And indeed that had that effect, but it was a wake up call to people. And now we're

382
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,280
starting to see nursing homes across the country take those extra measures to carefully screen

383
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,240
people going in and out of nursing homes to review all of their preparedness plans. And now

384
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,600
the Health and Human Services Secretary is mobilizing inspectors around infection control.

385
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,800
And that's an example of where over the years, I've always had this interesting career that

386
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,840
balances being a working scientist and MD, PhD vaccine scientist developing vaccines and for

387
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,600
neglected disease interventions with that advocacy in places that are where I've seen gaps. So I saw

388
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,400
a gap in getting people to care about these poverty related neglected diseases in the early

389
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,640
2000s and helped raise awareness that's now led to treatment of more than a billion people annually

390
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:28,120
for neglected tropical diseases, raising awareness about diseases of the poor in places like the

391
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,080
United States. And now we've been working with Senator Booker, Cory Booker around this issue,

392
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,720
getting people to counter the anti-vaccine movement. So I'm a parent of an adult daughter

393
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,360
with autism and wrote this book called Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism to kind of counter

394
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,560
the false narrative and the misinformation from the anti-vaccine movement. And here was another

395
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,240
example of using my voice to really help people who didn't have a voice otherwise.

396
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,400
Peter, what geographies in the United States are you most concerned about? And then I guess I would

397
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,480
also ask you that question at a global level, but we'll start maybe in the United States.

398
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:15,240
Well, I mean, right now it's all bets are off. I think any urban area of the US now is vulnerable.

399
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:22,200
And we've seen this now take off in Seattle. We've seen this take off in New Rochelle in

400
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,120
Westchester County. We're starting to see some uptick in New York City. And there's nothing

401
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:34,120
really unique about those cities other than their congregations of a big urban population. So on

402
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,760
that basis, I have to believe any large urban center is vulnerable. And it could be any places

403
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,920
vulnerable. It's just that urban areas tend to have more physicians and so more healthcare,

404
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,080
better public health infrastructure. So maybe it's just being picked up there for. So I said last

405
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,640
week, this is going to be a difficult week for America because the testing is going to start to

406
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,200
gear up. And now that it's in the hands of Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp and Roche, we're going to

407
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,600
get a much more full picture of the extent of this virus in the United States and North America.

408
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,640
And I think we're starting to see that the numbers are going up 1600. Who knows what it'll look like

409
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,920
by next week? Is it going to be 10 times that number? I think that's quite possible or even

410
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,960
more. And with that, we'll undoubtedly be picking up new foci of infection.

411
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,680
That's a pretty frightening thought to have a log increase in a week. But when you look at other

412
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,320
countries that have not done well, that's exactly what we have seen, isn't it?

413
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,080
Well, the question is whether that's the true log increase or whether we've had that

414
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:44,280
transmission all along. It's just that now we're cherry picking communities to detect it.

415
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,680
Or maybe both going on simultaneously. But I suspect we're going to see those numbers

416
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,120
deeply rise again. And so this gets back to my, what I was talking about with Mark Lipsich's

417
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:05,080
paper where he says the more sustained community transmission goes on, the health burden is going

418
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:12,120
to be in terms of hospital beds and ICU beds and the demands on healthcare staff. I think as we

419
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:18,280
pick up these new levels of transmission in places that's been going on for a while, next week. So

420
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,080
the horror this week was we realized we're seeing a lot more cases and maybe new areas of community

421
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,360
transmission. I would say the same for next week with the added piece. Now we're going to start to

422
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,760
see hospital beds fill up. And that's why I'm really pushing now for blood banks to implement

423
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,760
this new antibody therapy because I think the need's really going to be there. And if you don't offer

424
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,080
people any hope of anything, I think that's where panic starts to spread where you start seeing

425
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,160
panic, not only among the population but among the healthcare workers. And we've got to be able

426
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,720
to stop that. So I think just like this week was challenging because we're starting to see an

427
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,440
increase, I think in the next two weeks maybe the critical period when we may start to see

428
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,640
this start to reach a peak. Peter, do we have a sense of what the

429
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,600
excess capacity is in the ICU and where is the bottleneck going to be in the supply chain? Is

430
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,320
it the number of ventilators, the number of ICU beds or beds that could be repurposed for ICU? Is

431
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,160
it going to be the number of anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists, nurses? There are so many

432
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,960
things here. Yeah, I think only now we're really starting to look at this. And if you've ever

433
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,520
listened to Zeke Emanuel, he's been commenting a lot about this. We don't have a great capacity.

434
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,480
Hospitals for cost saving measures and everything else have operated at slim margins. So it's not

435
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,640
like we have a lot of excess capacity laying around. And does this mean we're going to have

436
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,200
to build tent city hospitals? Will we have to bring in the National Guard? I think all of that,

437
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,800
it's a big unknown. I mean, the only good thing that we have going for us is we did make that

438
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,200
sacrifice of shutting down things we love like the National Basketball Association, the NBA, and

439
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,760
the rodeo and that sort of thing. And that's a good thing about America. We did this to protect

440
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,760
our most vulnerable or older citizens, a lot of them veterans of foreign wars. And

441
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,720
I think that that's important. And maybe if there is a seasonality to this virus, maybe we're just

442
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,360
hitting it right in terms of moving it to warmer weather. But we have no evidence for that.

443
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,840
That certainly was not the case with the first SARS, right? I mean, it didn't seem to stop when

444
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,640
the summer came, did it? Well, you know, if you look at the curves, the peaks that I saw looked

445
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,720
like more around the springtime, but who knows? I mean, we certainly can't count on it. And there's

446
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,520
some people who feel that it may start to go down in the summer, but not disappear entirely and then

447
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,160
come back in the fall. So we just don't know. As I've also been saying is confronting a new serious

448
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,560
virus pathogen is one of the hardest things our country faces, has faced the last 20 years. And

449
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,480
it always starts out pretty bumpy and pretty rocky, I think, in part because it takes the CDC a while

450
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,960
to figure out how the federal government and the CDC how to work with state and local health

451
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,920
authorities. This one has been rockier than most because of the inability to do the testing and

452
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,000
other factors. But the problem is, unlike Ebola, which was never going to be transmitted widely

453
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,760
across the country because of that very low reproductive number, unless you're taking care

454
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,040
of a dead or dying Ebola patient, you're not going to get Ebola. This one is pretty transmissible. So

455
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,800
our margin for error is much smaller, as the studies in China have pointed out. So we could

456
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:51,000
be in for some very serious times. Mark Lipsich has stated that he believes we could be entering

457
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,320
kind of a new world where two years from now, half the world's population or thereabouts has

458
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:04,120
been infected by this virus. And even if you use the absolute lowest estimate of mortality that's

459
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:12,200
being provided, which is 0.5 percent or one in 200 people dying, the impact of what I just reiterated

460
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,480
as his estimate is staggering. Do you share that view or do you or do you at least think that that

461
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,640
is a plausible scenario? Yeah, it's absolutely plausible. And Mark's an outstanding epidemiologist.

462
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,040
And you know, a lot of these estimates are based on models. I would say the only thing about models,

463
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:34,520
and I'm not a modeler, but I've collaborated with modelers to look at projections of our different

464
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:42,680
vaccines and to give us a sense of what level of protection we would need to have a significant

465
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,200
impact on a population and how wide a coverage we would need. And one of the things that always

466
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:55,800
impresses me working with modelers is that a modest change in assumptions of what goes into

467
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,240
the model can often have huge differences. So the only comfort I take in that is to say, well, maybe

468
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,400
if those models are like the ones I've worked with, a few tweaks to the model can result in two or

469
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:17,480
three log reductions in deaths and cases and that sort of thing. So it's models are useful exercises

470
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,440
to help you think through problems, but how predictive they are is only as good as the

471
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,160
assumptions with the new virus agent where we don't even know all the modes of transmission

472
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,200
and everything else. They'll fully understand reproductive number that might help us.

473
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,720
Yeah, as a physicist, a very famous physicist once said, all models are wrong, some are useful.

474
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,520
So hopefully that model is woefully wrong. But I think part of that is, as you said,

475
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,760
it's a little bit in our hands how wrong that model is going to be, isn't it? I mean, it's still

476
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,160
we still have some say over our response to this, both in terms at the federal level,

477
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,120
but also at the local and state level. And then at the individual level, we can all take steps

478
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:06,200
to reduce our risk and buy more time. How are you thinking about this? I don't want to say

479
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,360
personally, because you're in a very unique position where you have to be out there talking

480
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,760
about this. You don't have the luxury of maybe being a little bit more sequestered. But are there

481
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,720
a certain subset of people that at this point, Peter, you would say absolutely need to be

482
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,440
self-quarantined, either the symptomatic folks, obviously, who run the risk of infecting others

483
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,080
if they can't be tested, but also people who are showing no signs or symptoms, but who are at high

484
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,400
enough risk. How are you helping people create their own sort of framework around that very

485
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,000
difficult decision? Well, certainly older individuals where they're clustering together,

486
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,560
we've seen the devastation. So we can't repeat the debacle that we had in that nursing home. And so

487
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,680
it's all hands on deck with protecting those individuals. Then you can say, okay, Peter,

488
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:00,040
well, tell us what that means. Does that mean thinking of my 90 year old mother in the Hebrew

489
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,280
home in Brooklyn, outside of Brookline, Massachusetts? Do we now tell her that she has to stay in her

490
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,480
room and can't go down to the cafeteria and sit with her friends? Is that what you're telling us?

491
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:18,760
So these are going to be really tough decisions. We know how important socialization is for older

492
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:25,320
people, for anybody, right? But for older people in nursing facilities, that's really heartbreaking.

493
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,200
So Dr. Hotez, is he telling us that the grandkids can't visit? So these are really

494
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,480
tough decisions for us. Because at what point do you say, we know older populations are so fragile

495
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:46,200
in terms of suffering serious mental decline. And do you want to do that just to protect them from

496
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:54,200
this virus? And this is where I say, well, I'm a vaccine scientist. I'm pretty good at understanding

497
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,240
infectious disease, epidemiology, because I've had to really understand how to make the best vaccine.

498
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,840
But there's a certain point where the decisions become so tricky that I have to say, no, I'm

499
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:13,000
starting to exceed the limits of my comfort zone. And here's where we start needing some federal

500
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,680
guidance, state and federal guidance, people to really think about this very deeply and bringing

501
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,800
experts together that understand that. And I don't see that happening, unfortunately. What I'd like

502
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,920
to see are key task force created around not in general, as has been done, the president's created

503
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,720
sort of an overarching task force for this. But there are so many specialized pieces to this that

504
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:44,040
we have to focus on, like creating an antibody based technology, bring those experts together,

505
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,160
bring experts together around what nursing homes are like and how they're structured,

506
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,240
which would include experts in the mental health of older people, those experts in diabetes,

507
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,520
hypertension to understand what's going on. And I think that's going to be really critical as well.

508
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,440
Peter, what are you personally going to be paying closest attention to in the next seven days besides

509
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,280
the potential for using convalescent serum both from the sort of clinical trial standpoint and or

510
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,360
utilization standpoint? And in terms of data that are going to say, hey, are we heading towards the

511
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:28,760
Italian path or are we heading towards sort of the Singapore path? What data are you monitoring

512
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:34,680
closely? Well, certainly, incidents and prevalence data is going to be really important because right

513
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:41,160
now there's none, right? We've done so little testing. So as we ramp up and also starting to see

514
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,320
which new communities are becoming infected, I think that's going to be absolutely critical and

515
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,240
seeing if the situation that we've seen in the Pacific Northwest and New Rochelle is being

516
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:00,120
replicated elsewhere or the demographics taking on a different characteristic. Those are some of

517
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,840
the big things that I'll be looking for. And then also there are some vaccine trials that have

518
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,600
started in the Washington area. Interest in following those because my understanding is

519
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,200
the one in Seattle began with one of the vaccine trial evaluation units at the University of

520
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,240
Washington and it was initiated at a time where there wasn't transmission of this virus. Now there

521
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:29,000
is. So you're doing something that is going to be very interesting but also a little bit scary

522
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,440
because if there is immune enhancement, now we're going to start to see it among those volunteers

523
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,920
who are getting immunized. Peter, I want to be respectful of your time and I promised you we

524
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,840
would only take an hour. We've now gone a little over an hour. So I want to let you go with the

525
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,720
ask that either we can speak again, either formally or informally because again, I think it's probably

526
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,080
less important to spend hours at any one point in time and maybe more important to. And this is

527
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:01,240
what I've been saying, you know, on CNN, Fox and MSNBC and it's not easy going from one network to

528
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,280
the other, right? Especially those networks. Yeah. Well, you know, one, you have to say something

529
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,200
nice about the president. The other one, you're not allowed to say anything nice about the president.

530
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,600
It's also polarized and threading that needle is interesting. But one of the things I always say

531
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:23,560
is this is where we are right now. And this virus is racing so quickly that new pathogens in general

532
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,680
set you up to look stupid because even when you're trying to learn something about a new pathogen,

533
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,120
but this one, especially because it's so fast moving and transmissible, I would cringe if I

534
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,040
were to look at my interviews from two or three weeks ago in terms of the things I said, I think,

535
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,080
and probably a month from now, I would say, Oh my God, I can't believe I said that is what we're

536
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,840
talking about now. So I think absolutely that's important to update this and to say, to take a

537
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:56,280
step back and look to see what have we learned in the last week. And because we're trying to make

538
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,240
our best guesses, best estimates on what we're seeing now, but this is, as I say, it's moving

539
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,800
so quickly. We have to continually reevaluate that. And that's why I'd like to see the white house

540
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,560
out there every day because this thing is moving so quickly. Yeah. Well, look, for those listening

541
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,560
to this, probably on a Saturday, it's now Friday night in real time, March 13th, Peter, let's let

542
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:27,080
you get back to work. Let's touch base next week and continue to look at the data and in real time,

543
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,160
try to come up with the best assessments of what we can. Thank you very much, Peter. Thanks for

544
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,360
having me. Thanks for all your great work. One of the things that I do when I give talks about

545
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,400
confronting anti-science, and I do that a lot standing up to the anti-vaccine movement, I say

546
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,920
part of this is our fault because as physicians and scientists, we're too inward looking. We've

547
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:54,120
somehow decided that engaging public audiences is not important. And so the kinds of things you're

548
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:01,400
doing is really critical to break that. I think the best weapon against ignorance and false

549
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,720
information is the kinds of things that you're doing. So I just want to congratulate you on what

550
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,880
you're doing and there's nothing more important. Thank you, Peter. We greatly appreciate it. And

551
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,720
I hope you get some rest tonight and we'll be back in touch next week. Thanks. Me too. I hope

552
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:19,160
we get some rest. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive. If you're interested
